Dark World Reborn

The game includes a variety of content and game mechanics, many that can be turned on or off through Game Rules.
It also offers some Campaign options, which are intended long term to provide additional story elements, although right now, most only provide a decision that is activated in the Intrigue Decision menu, where it provides a trait or character modifier and some additional back ground.
