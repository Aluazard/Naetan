eros_duo_DESC;The Duo of Eros refers to the two gods Eros, and Alva. Of these Eros leads the duo of the Nua in their fight against Thanatos the dark god. /n The main difference between the duo and the triad is that some believe that in fact Thalassa betrayed Eros, joining Thanatos in his dark war. This leads to the diverging religions, as well as this those who believe in the duo do not have a Paragon, rather they have no religious head instead seeking the power of the gods individually. The rites of this religion often involve religious carnal acts, and there is no stigma against marriage of family members. For the Nua intercourse is considered a sacred rite to be shared with all, however interspecies relations are frowned upon.;;;;;;;;;;x
