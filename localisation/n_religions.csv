eros_triad_desc;The Triad of Eros refers to the three gods Eros, Alva, and Thalassa. Of these Eros leads the triumvrate of the Nua in their fight against Thanatos the dark god. /n The religion of the triad is loosely based around the Paragon, the voice of the gods. The rites of this religion often involve religious carnal acts, and there is no stigma against marriage of family members. For the Nua intercourse is considered a sacred rite to be shared with all, however interspecies relations are frowned upon.;;;;;;;;;;x

eros_duo_desc;The Duo of Eros refers to the two gods Eros, and Alva. Of these Eros leads the duo of the Nua in their fight against Thanatos the dark god. /n The main difference between the duo and the triad is that some believe that in fact Thalassa betrayed Eros, joining Thanatos in his dark war. This leads to the diverging religions, as well as this those who believe in the duo do not have a Paragon, rather they have no religious head instead seeking the power of the gods individually. The rites of this religion often involve religious carnal acts, and there is no stigma against marriage of family members. For the Nua intercourse is considered a sacred rite to be shared with all, however interspecies relations are frowned upon.;;;;;;;;;;x

paragons_cryta_desc;Unlike the other religions in the Pantheon of Eros, the Paragons are a militant religious order. They call themselves the shield of Eros, protecting the Nua from supernatual threats of all kinds, whether they be internal or external. Their lands start and end in the Cryta peninsula. /n The rites of this religion heavily involve courage and sacrifice, honour as well. Despite this there is still no stigma against marraige of family members. For the Nua intercourse is considered a sacred rite to be shared with all, however interspecies relations forbidden on pain of death.;;;;;;;;;;x

communion_whispers_full;Communion of Whispers;;;;;;;;;;x
communion_whispers_desc;Although mostly a secret sect of the pantheon, this heresy sometimes arises in various metropolitan areas of the Nua. The religion mostly focuses on interspecies and zoophilic intercourse, both of these especially taboo in Nua culture. /n The rites of this religion lean heavily on the profane in Nua culture, engaging in interspecies and zoophilic sexuality. The members of this religion wear these exploits as badges of honour, though maybe not in public.;;;;;;;;;;x
