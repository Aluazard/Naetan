eros_triad_DESC;The Triad of Eros refers to the three gods Eros, Alva, and Thalassa. Of these Eros leads the triumvrate of the Nua in their fight against Thanatos the dark god. The religion of the triad is loosely based around the Paragon, the voice of the gods. The rites of this religion often involve organised religious acts, and there is no stigma against marriage of relatives. \n For Nua, the sanctity of marriage or one whom you share your bed with cannot taint the racial purity of the great Nua race, because of this all interspecies or interracial marriage is banned on pain of death.;;;;;;;;;;x

eros_duo_DESC;The Duo of Eros refers to the two gods Eros, and Alva. Of these Eros leads the duo of the Nua in their fight against Thanatos the dark god. The main difference between the duo and the triad is that some believe that in fact Thalassa betrayed Eros, joining Thanatos in his dark war. This leads to the diverging religions, as well as this those who believe in the duo do not have a Paragon, rather they have no religious head instead seeking the power of the gods individually. The rites of this religion often involve organised religious acts, and there is no stigma against marriage of relatives.\n For Nua, the sanctity of marriage or one whom you share your bed with cannot taint the racial purity of the great Nua race, because of this all interspecies or interracial marriage is banned on pain of death.;;;;;;;;;;x

paragons_cryta_DESC;Unlike the other religions in the Pantheon of Eros, the Paragons are a militant religious order. They call themselves the shield of Eros, protecting the Nua from supernatual threats of all kinds, whether they be internal or external. Their lands start and end in the Cryta peninsula. The rites of this religion heavily involve courage and sacrifice, honour as well. Despite this there is still no stigma against marraige of family members. \n For Nua, the sanctity of marriage or one whom you share your bed with cannot taint the racial purity of the great Nua race, because of this all interspecies or interracial marriage is banned on pain of death.;;;;;;;;;;x

communion_whispers_DESC;Although mostly a secret sect of the pantheon, this heresy sometimes arises in various metropolitan areas of the Nua. The religion mostly focuses on vile taboo of the explicit nature, breaking the Nuan code of racial purity. The members of this religion wear these exploits as badges of honour, though maybe not in public.;;;;;;;;;;x

phezeth_DESC;The Bloodkin of Phezeth raid and destroy in the name of the dark god Phezeth. He supplies them with supernatural strength and prowess in battle, and in return they destroy and pillage all who stand in their way. There is no friend or foe, only the strong and weak.
