#Event Descriptions
DWWerewolf2199;Fate seems to elude me as little in my hunt goes as planned. I'm starving, angry, and I've injured my leg. The moon no longer feels like it's lighting my way. Instead it's almost mocking me. Highlighting my failures on the night's landscape. I stumble as I attempt to make it back home. My vision is a deep red hue and I can hear the beast in my blood roaring for control. \n  I... I can... Almost home... Consciousness leaves me, yet instead of falling, I feel as though my body is running wild... \n  When morning comes, I find myself in a field, alone and covered in blood that isn't mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2199A;Who's blood is this? I need to get home and tend to my leg.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf3000;I follow the scent of a nearby bitch, finding [Root.dw_selected_bitch.GetFirstName] fast asleep. I pull back the blankets and find her naked. My cock thickens as I climb onto the bed. She lazily stirs until I grab her and plunge my cock into her cunt. \n  Her eyes open wide and she gasps, breathing in deep my scent. Her eyes glaze lustfully as I fuck her ferociously. The beast within calls for the need to fill her with seed. I respond by pounding her so hard that she can do little more than grunt and accept it. I feel my balls tighten as they ready to fire. I slam it in deep, holding her firmly as I explode within her, causing her to whimper as she trembles with her own orgasm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf3000A;May your womb accept my seed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf3010;I follow the scent of a bitch in heat, and find [Root.dw_selected_bitch.GetFirstName] in the middle of masturbating. She pauses when I enter, her eyes filled with both fear and lust. I push her back on the bed, and pull the phallus from her pussy, causing her to moan and whimper. \n  I hold her face near my pussy as I sink the phallus into me. Her eyes look up at me, pleading for approval as she flicks her tongue out against my clit. I crouch down between her legs, and rub the other end of the phallus over her asshole. \n  Her eyes plead, uncertain as I push it forth, sinking it into her ass. Once in, we entwine our legs and gyrate against each other. The sensation is perfect as I use the bitch and her toy to bring myself to a powerful orgasm. My desires are sated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf3010A;I may have use for you again bitch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf3005;I awaken with a jolt as my pussy emits wave of pain and pleasure. My mind reels at the hot breath on the nape of my neck and the thick musky smell of one of my betters. I instinctively arch my back to better receive their thrusts. \n  Pleasure quickly consumes me as I enter a daze from the frantic pounding of my pussy. I'm insanely wet, and feel my gut tighten in anticipation of receiving my visitor's seed. \n  It isn't long before I feel [From.GetHerHis] cock swell, followed by warmth as I'm filled with [From.GetHerHis] cum as [From.GetSheHe] growls in satisfaction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf3005A;Unh, yes, yes, I'm CUMMMMMMMMMIIIINNNNNNG!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf3020;I follow the scent of a nearby bitch, finding [Root.dw_selected_bitch.GetFirstName] preparing for bed. I enter her room, and she gasps as I make my presence known. My cock thickens as her gaze falls to it. Her eyes glaze lustfully as I move her to the bed and push her down on all fours. I slap my engorged cock against her ass, causing her to arch her back and moan in response. \n  I slid my cock into her wet pussy and begin a rhythmic motion. She grips the blankets and matches my motion with her hips. The bitch has it, bringing me to orgasm quickly as I flood her pussy. \n  She moans in disappointment as I chuckle and slap my still hard cock on her ass. She looks over her shoulder a little uncertain as I place the tip of my dick against her anus and push it in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf3020A;I like to double-tap my bitches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf9900;Rrrraah! I, we, HUNGER! No. Freedom. Flee. Hunt. I, we shed all ties! KILL YOU!!! .... Before you kill us, me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf9900A;New land, new food, new hunt for I, we, us, me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf4000;I recline in the crisp evening air. Gazing out towards the moon in all of its brilliance. "Here's to you," I proclaim as I hoist high a bottle of booze. \n  I nod in return to an imagined acknowledgement from the moon, and then take a good sized drink from the booze. Closing my eyes as it makes its way down my throat, I can almost imagine the cries of the beast as it is drowned with alcohol. I feel it stir, trying to break free and gasp for air, so I take another pull from the bottle. \n  Even if it's only temporary, the beast will not hold sway over me this night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf4000A;Bottom's up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2100;I head into the night in search of wildlife to claim as my prey. I reach a clearing where the moonlight seems to sparkle and dance in the night air. I raise my head and sniff to see what is nearby. \n  Moments pass and I catch a scent. A deer. A worthy target. I begin moving in the direction of my prey and decide how I shall pursue it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2100A;I use tactics to corner and finish my prey;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2100B;I use stealth to stalk and ambush my prey;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2100C;I hunt my prey to the best of my abilities;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2190;As I tear out the first chunk of flesh with my teeth, I feel the beast within me sated. There is something satisfying in both landing the killing blow, and being able to consume good meat afterwards. \n  I howl to the moon, thanking her for the brilliant illumination as I enjoy the flesh of my kill. I rend away another handful of blood soaked muscle from my prey and enjoy the meal under mother moon's gaze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2190A;A worth while hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf4020;I hear them. All of them. The beast isn't a single voice. It's a pack. \n  They see the corruption all around me. I am in danger. My life, they seek to protect me, not to ruin me. The pack. I am of the pack and the pack protects its own. One voice is louder than the others. It sounds like my own. I can save not only myself, but others. But what others? It's hard to grasp. Enemies. I have no friends. Those who are silent today will stand against me tomorrow. \n  I shake my head. The voices. The quiet for the moment. Or have they?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DWWerewolf4020A;We can control this... We? I? Am I more than me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf4010;I'm beginning to question my wisdom in believing I could tame the beast without participating in a hunt. I lay here in bed, listening to the blood pounding through my veins, crying out, threatening to drown me, when I suddenly feel something upon my chest. \n  I growl as I look to find a cat sitting upon me. The cat seems unimpressed at my growl as it stares back at me, and for a second the howl of the beast inside subsides. The cat taps me with its paw and flicks it's tail. I recognize the intent. It desires attention. \n  I lift a clawed hand and find that I lack the desire to gut it. I stroke it's back, and it begins purring and kneading my chest with its claws. I notice the beast within is quieting. As though it's being lulled to sleep by my little visitor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf4010A;I always found touching pussy to be calming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf1100;As you near adulthood, I hear the wild call of the beast in my veins grow stronger with each passing year. I seem to instinctively know that to try and tame the beast within me, I must hone your skills in the hunt. \n  I've a pair of options before me. Shall I set out in search of a target to stalk, honing my skills to go unnoticed? Or shall I taste raw flesh by hunting down some poor creature, out in the wild, under the full moon? What does the beast within call for to sate it's hunger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf1100A;Stalk prey;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf1100B;Hunt prey;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf1110;I choose to stalk my prey. I head out to the edge of town, slinking through the evening shadows. I spy a farmer and his son, leaving after what was likely a day where they brought goods to the market. \n  I follow them, staying low, moving quickly from shadow to shadow. I listen to their words, meaningless babble, little more than a mule braying at the sun. \n  The sun disappears, as their home nears. They think they're safe. Timing their travel to arrive home just after dark. I make my move, dashing out as they near their door. I leap and swipe. The boy's straw hat is knocked off clearly. He turns and I'm no longer there. If called upon to hunt man, I know that I can. The beast cries for blood, but I know we're not to kill needlessly. Yet when the time comes... I can strike unseen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf1110A;They'll never know how I could have finished them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf1120;I choose to hunt. I've been warned many times that when hunting, it is important to not loose myself to the call. That the beast within us demands the hunt, and if we're not worthy enough, the beast within will consume our mind as we consume our prey. \n  The moon is high, and I feel my blood scream in joy at its sight. I howl, seeking to let the moon know that I'm worthy of its light. I hear movement nearby, something fleeing my cry. \n  I give chase, finding that I can cover ground quicker on all fours. I burst through into a clearing and catch site of rabbit trying to flee. I pursue it, smelling its fear. I catch it, rend it. Consume it. I shake my head to clear the fog, and stand, victorious in the hunt. Arching my back, I howl to the moon to share word of the kill in its honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf1120A;I can see the draw of the beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf1190;I return home, sneaking into my room. I limp uncomfortably to my bed, taking care to not put too much weight on my leg. The bleeding has stopped, and the wound itself isn't that bad. \n  I attempt to stand straight and grimace in pain. I don't believe anything is broken, but it'll take time to heal none the less. I can see the questions, the disappointment at a failed hunt. Rest. If I rest enough, surely I'll be able to walk better tomorrow. If it doesn't appear that bad, perhaps I can pass it off without drawing any looks of disappointment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf1190A;This will heal over time and I shall improve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf1180;I return home and stop to look up at the moon. Tonight may not have gone as planned, but it was a good night. The thrill was there, and I felt the light of the moon fill me, replacing the roar of the beast within me. \n  I stifle a grin to keep from looking the fool, while letting my eyes scan the shadows. Seeing no one, I slip into my room unseen. I leap into my bed, and notice for the first time that my activities have left me weary. I collapse in a heap, and allow myself the fool's grin as I look forward to the dreams of tonight's activities that will soon come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf1180A;Not the best hunt, but I've rarely felt so alive before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2000;I can feel the beast within me calling for release. I find myself staring intently at others, getting distracted by sounds nearby, and following scents on the air. I need to address the call. \n  I make my way outside. The evening is young. Looking out I see the moon rising, illuminating the world with its sublime light. \n  I close my eyes and listen to the beast inside my blood, seeking the answer which will best tame it and allow me to remain in control of my body. Exhaling, I know my path. I've made my decision for this evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2000A;I shall seek out a kill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2000B;I must sate my lust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2000C;I will follow the voice of the beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2000D;I must relax to quell the beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2010;My blood calls for the blood of another. If I fail to sate my hunger, I may loose ground to the beast within. \n  My options are clear. I can seek to bring down an animal, feeding my hunger with it's raw flesh. I can take a more dangerous path and seek a person as my prey, slaking my thirst as I bite down on their neck. Or I can let the beast decide, as it knows best how to appease itself. \n  Enough contemplation. My course is decided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2010A;I shall hunt wildlife;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2010B;A person shall be my prey;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2010C;I shall hunt my rival, [dw_hunt_rival.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2010D;I shall let the beast decide;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2020;The beast within is driving my lust. I desire release both from the beast's urges as well as my own. \n  The wind carries to me various scents that cause the yearning within to distract me. There are those who can sate my thirst. It's only a matter of where shall I go to extinguish the fire within me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2020A;I shall use an available bitch;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2020B;I shall seek a new conquest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2020C;I shall use an Omega Male;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2020D;*PLACEHOLDER* I shall let the beast decide;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2040;There are other ways to silence the beast. Fenris obviously has control over it and he's not always hunting and baying at the moon like a beast. I too can overcome it through means other than killing and screwing. \n  I feel the beast inside almost surge with what feels like laughter. I laugh in return. We shall see who will win out in the end this evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2040A;Alcohol can drown away any worry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2040B;Knowledge shall give me power over the beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2040C;*PLACEHOLDER*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2040D;Rest and relaxation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf5000;I don't recall when exactly I heard it, all I know now is that the sound envelops me, calls to me. My body dances of it's own accord, yet even as I realize this, there is no anger or disappointment. I'm dancing and I feel peaceful as I move around the source of the music. \n  Elves are a rarity, so rare that most view them as mere fables, yet here is an elven child putting her soul into her instrument. I can't even say that she realizes I'm here, as her focus is solely on the music. An enchanting sound, that somehow conveys hope, joy, and love. It's then that I notice I don't hear the beast within me. \n  By the time my body finally stops, I know not where the little elf went, or even exactly when she stopped playing. I see the morning sun rising, and decide to head off back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf5000A;In hindsight, I did pretty well with my dance moves too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2198;Fate seems to elude me as little in my hunt goes as planned. I'm starving and angry as my prey managed to escape me. The moon no longer feels like it's lighting my way. Instead it's almost mocking me. Highlighting my failures on the night's landscape. I stumble as I attempt to make it back home. My vision is a deep red hue and I can hear the beast in my blood roaring for control. \n  I... I can... Almost home... Consciousness leaves me, yet instead of falling, I feel as though my body is running wild... \n  When morning comes, I find myself in a field, alone and covered in blood that isn't mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2198A;Who's blood is this? I need to get home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2191;I howl as I stand victorious over my prey. More than just a hunt, it turned out to be a worthy feat of combat as well, for the prey sought to turn the tables upon me. It fought well, and for that, I shall enjoy this meal all the more as I reach out and rend away a piece of its flesh. \n  As I consume the worthy prey under Mother Moon's illumination, I can feel its essence filling me and sating the hunger of the beast within.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2191A;May all hunts be so worthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2192;I howl as I stand victorious over my prey. More than just a hunt, it turned out to be a worthy feat of combat as well, for the prey sought to turn the tables upon me. It fought well, managing to wound me before it fell, and for that, I shall enjoy this meal all the more as I reach out and rend away a piece of its flesh. \n  As I consume the worthy prey under Mother Moon's illumination, I can feel its essence filling me, easing the pain from my wound and sating the hunger of the beast within.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2192A;I must improve so that I can avoided getting wounded in future hunts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2110;I'm moving across the landscape, under the watchful illumination of the moon overhead. I catch a scent, nearby and my ears inform me that it noticed me as well. I crouch and prepare to spring as a large bear wanders into sight. It's growl making it clear that it doesn't intend to be taken without a fight. \n  A potentially worthy hunt, although one that does carry the risk of injury should I fail to best it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2110A;I calm my knocking knees and prepare to face the beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2110B;I shall defeat my prey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2110C;I've no desire to risk serious injury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2197;Fate seems to elude me as facing my prey goes horribly wrong, my body broken and maimed before my prey moves on. I'm in pain, starving and ashamed. The moon no longer feels like it's lighting my way. Instead it's almost mocking me. Highlighting my failures on the night's landscape. I stumble as I attempt to make it back home. My vision is a deep red hue and I can hear the beast in my blood roaring for control. \n  I... I can... Almost home... Consciousness leaves me, yet instead of falling, I feel as though my body is running wild... \n  When morning comes, I find myself in a field, alone and covered in blood that isn't mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2197A;I need to get home and tend my wounds else the worsen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2196;Fate seems to elude me as facing my prey goes horribly wrong, as I'm wounded and unable to pursue my prey as it moves on. I'm in pain, starving and ashamed. The moon no longer feels like it's lighting my way. Instead it's almost mocking me. Highlighting my failures on the night's landscape. I stumble as I attempt to make it back home. My vision is a deep red hue and I can hear the beast in my blood roaring for control. \n  I... I can... Almost home... Consciousness leaves me, yet instead of falling, I feel as though my body is running wild... \n  When morning comes, I find myself in a field, alone and covered in blood that isn't mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2196A;I need to get home and tend my wounds else the worsen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2195;Fate seems to elude me as facing my prey goes horribly wrong. I failed to defeat my prey, as it proved as competent as I in battle, until it managed to slip away. I'm starving, angry and ashamed. The moon no longer feels like it's lighting my way. Instead it's almost mocking me. Highlighting my failures on the night's landscape. I stumble as I attempt to make it back home. My vision is a deep red hue and I can hear the beast in my blood roaring for control. \n  I... I can... Almost home... Consciousness leaves me, yet instead of falling, I feel as though my body is running wild... \n  When morning comes, I find myself in a field, alone and covered in blood that isn't mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2195A;Who's blood is this? I must get home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2194;I ignore the beast within me as I force myself to flee in order to avoid potentially harming myself. I'm starving and ashamed. The moon no longer feels like it's lighting my way. Instead it's almost mocking me, along with the beast's voice within me. Highlighting my failures on the night's landscape. I stumble as I attempt to make it back home. My vision is a deep red hue and I can hear the beast in my blood roaring for control as I'm unworthy. \n  I... I can... Almost home... Consciousness leaves me, yet instead of falling, I feel as though my body is running wild... \n  When morning comes, I find myself in a field, alone and covered in blood that isn't mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2194A;Who's blood is this? I must get home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2120;I'm in an unfamiliar place when I notice how alive the woods seem around me. Even in the evening moonlight, they seem almost radiant, unnatural. It's then that I catch a scent nearby and I feel my fur bristle as the scent is accompanied by an aura of killing intent. \n  I don't have to move far before I see a large bear-like creature emerge before me, marked with the pattern that clearly defines the beast as a Spirit Bear. Nature's embodiment of the power and might of the creatures. I sense that it sees me not as a predator, yet as prey. \n  The beast within me seems to be singing with the urge to face it, while my instincts warn me of the potential death that awaits me. I tense as I prepare my move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2120A;I put my life on the line as I charge forth to slay the Spirit Bear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2120B;I recognize the death when I see it, so I flee as quickly as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2121;The battle is impressive. When I finally find myself standing over the Spirit Bear's body, I'm surprised to find myself unscathed. I notice the surrounding landscape is already beginning to lose some of its radiance, a sure sign that the Spirit Bear's essence is passing. \n  The beast within me is silent, it's hunger sated by the glorious battle. It's then that I hear another voice, the instinctual whispers of Mother Moon, the Spirit Bear offers a boon to those who defeat it. Consume the still warm flesh and obtain a measure of its strength, or meditate and open my senses as it passes and gain insight into the unique knowledge it contains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2121A;I consume the warm flesh, claiming its strength as my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2121B;I meditate, catching glimpses of its knowledge and insight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2122;The battle is impressive. When I finally find myself standing over the Spirit Bear's body, I'm bearing a wound, yet not one that should be lethal. I notice the surrounding landscape is already beginning to lose some of its radiance, a sure sign that the Spirit Bear's essence is passing. \n  The beast within me is silent, it's hunger sated by the glorious battle. It's then that I hear another voice, the instinctual whispers of Mother Moon, the Spirit Bear offers a boon to those who defeat it. Consume the still warm flesh and obtain a measure of its strength, or meditate and open my senses as it passes and gain insight into the unique knowledge it contains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2124;I leap away from the Spirit Bear, and flee with every ounce of speed I can call forth. I can sense it pursuing, death charging after me. It's not until I reach a clearing by a farm that the aura of death behind me stops. \n  I keep running, although now it's less from the Spirit Bear and more from the howling fury within my head. I stumble, crashing to the ground and my consciousness fades to red as the beast within catches me. \n  I awaken the next morning, uncertain exactly where I am. After wandering for nearly an hour, I finally get my bearings and deduce the route back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2124A;I must get back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2125;The battle with the Spirit Bear does not end in my favor. I am still alive, but I'm wounded, while the Spirit Bear still lives. Perhaps I should be thankful that I managed to at least drive it off after it wounded me, as I could be dead. \n  Besides having survived, another benefit is the beast seems satisfied by the battle, although as I make slow progress home, that somehow seems shallow. Almost as though I deserve it's mocking, rage inspired rantings for failing. \n  It is what it is, so I focus simply on making my way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2125A;I must return home and tend to my wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2126;The battle with the Spirit Bear does not end in my favor. I am still alive, but I'm maimed while the Spirit Bear still lives. Perhaps I should be thankful that after it broke me, that for some reason it decided to not finish me, as I could be dead. \n  Besides having survived, another benefit is the beast seems satisfied by the battle, although as I make slow progress home, that somehow seems shallow. Almost as though I deserve it's mocking, rage inspired rantings for failing. \n  It is what it is, so I focus simply on making my way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2126A;I must return home and seek aid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2130;I've been tracking some deer for nearly an hour when I spot them. Not only them, but a group of poachers as well, about eight in all from what I can sense. \n  There are enough deer that I can ignore the poachers and pursue one myself. Or, I could face the poachers, for after all, they're hunting on lands and game that do not belong to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2130A;I've no interest in poachers and pursue the game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2130B;I shall confront the poachers, as these are my lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2131;I get closer to the poachers, listening and watching them. They don't notice me yet, although I can see that all eight are armed with bows and either a poorly made sword or dagger. Making the only thing potentially problematic, is their numbers. \n  As I get closer, I can tell that a couple of them are malnourished, and not a one of them is well fed. I can understand the drive to survive, yet the drive to survive doesn't mean that all may achieve it. As I continue to approach, I come to a decision on how I shall face them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2131A;I shall make it a simple choice, leave or die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2131B;I shall pick them off and leave none behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2131C;A show of strength and I wager they'll flee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2131D;They're starving fools, I'll gift them what remains of my kill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2132;My message is heard loud and clear by the poachers. While a couple seem to waiver, it's quickly apparent that they'd be on their own, and against two malnourished peasants, the odds are clearly in my favor. \n  After coming to an understanding, I depart to complete my pursuit of one of the deer. With luck on my side as the herd didn't stray far at all, soon leaving me standing over my kill, with a howl of victory echoing through the air.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2132A;I'm grateful that only the blood of the deer had to be shed today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2133;The fools. I don't know if it's their hunger, their pride, or perhaps even a hatred for me or my kind that fuels them forward as they fight to try and slay me. Regardless, all that I know is the beast within me has forgotten about the hunt, and it simply howls with rage as it desires to rend the flesh of these pitiful, foolish poachers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2133A;I let my rage fuel me, sparing no quarter as I slaughter them all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2133B;I push myself, seeking to kill them all and spare no one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2133C;I strike with restraint, seeking to break them instead of kill them all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2134;Striking at those in the rear or at the outer flanks, I've taken out half their number before they begin to realize something is amiss. Panic begins to grip them and as I drop another, I allow him to scream. The results are as expected as the remaining poachers flee. \n  They don't make it far, as none are quicker than I. I strike one and continue on to the next, nullifying the advantage that normally comes from being able to simply outrun your companions. Soon, as the last one gasps for breath through a torn out throat, I leave the poachers behind and continue my pursuit of dinner. \n  After a short while, I have a fine deer. As I tear into its flesh, I feel the beast within is content from both the ambush and subsequent hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2134A;Tonight's hunt was a fine hunt indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf3100;I head out into the night, seeking a woman to bring into the fold as a bitch. It's while passing a graveyard that a scent of a woman who is in need of rutting catches my attention. I enter the graveyard and find her, apparently lost in thought as she is crouched down by a gravestone. \n  I'm already hard and dripping precum as I move behind her. She notices my shadow, but it's too late. With a clawed hand I shred her clothing that blocks me and use the other to pull her to me. I lift her and slide my cock into her as my needs scream for release. \n  Holding onto her, I fuck her hard and fast. She can do little more than grit her teeth and hold on as I pound away until I cum hard and fill her with my seed. \n  Her pussy full, but my cock still hard, I decide to fill her again. Impaling her ass on my rod.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf3100A;[dw_graveyard_bitch.GetFirstName] is now a bitch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf3100B;[dw_graveyard_bitch.GetFirstName] was a good fuck, but somehow managed to not become a bitch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf3100C;[dw_graveyard_bitch.GetFirstName] was a good fuck, but I awoke an alpha bitch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf3199;I'm in heat. I'm seeking a new conquest to fulfil my needs, yet I can't seem to concentrate enough. The beast that is screaming in my blood, almost seems focused around my groin. I can smell my own scent and it is overpowering. I stumble, and sprawl on the ground. I moan from the pressure of the earth against my breasts, as though it's a firm hand squeezing them. I try to focus and lean back to pick myself up. Only I can't lift my hips, as my swollen pussy grinds on the ground. \n  I lose myself, the heat is too much. I reach down with my own hands and try to release the pressure. It's not enough so I press myself against a tree, and grind and hump it. I need more, the beast seeks release...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf3199A;I awaken in the morning, raw and tender from last night's ordeal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf4030;The beast within me is a primal force. From a time when we were more basic beings. I like to believe I'm above that now. Educated and aware of myself. I refuse to give credence to the beast within me as I sit down and open one of my books. \n  It's difficult at first, yet as I proceed, the howling rage within me seems to fade as I continue to focus on reading. At some point I'm continuing on, more from interest in the subject matter than I am in distracting myself from the beast. As the candle burns on, I'm not quite certain when it happens, but at some point, with the beast's voice all but subdued and the moon preparing to give way to day, I fall asleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf4030A;I awaken the next morning, refreshed and still myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2299;I've been defeated. As I feel my life draining from my body, I hear the soothing whisper of Mother Moon over the howling of the beast within me. The beast within me fades, it's maddening call ending as my awareness fades. All that is left is her voice. My spirit answers her call, leaving my mortal body behind as I seek to be by her side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2299A;My spirit joins Mother Moon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2200;I am out seeking prey, finding a suitable challenge when I notice movement and barely avoid being struck by a thrown knife. I growl a challenge as I seek who dared attack me, only to find the cold eyes of one of the Red Riding Sisterhood staring back at me. \n  I find it hard to pick up her scent, and I see form her attire the signs of competence as her armor shows signs of battles survived. She begins to close as her blades begin their dance of death. I feel the beast within me give an unsettling growl as though even it recognizes the dangers before me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2200A;I fear no red wench, so I too close to fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2200B;I did not come here to die, so I flee as best I can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2294;I manage to flee from the danger. The beast within me howling in frustration. Almost as though it's just as angry at itself as it is me for it's brief wavering of confidence when we stood before our foe. \n  Any thought that the beast may subside though disappears as it has convinced itself that the reason it faltered was because of my inadequacies. It's hard, because I've no answer for its accusations. It becomes so unbearable that I welcome the red haze and the loss of consciousness as it's anger consumes me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2294A;When I awaken, I begin the long walk home, listening as the beast whispers my failures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2295;I have failed. In what can only be described as embarrassing display of martial ability, I failed to get the kill. I shake my head to try and lose the howling of the beast that is ridiculing my conservative approach to the fight. \n  I can't deny it, my failure to take risks never fully pressed my foe, and in the end, they had an adequate window to escape and they took it. I was so stunned, that I failed to pursue right away and ended up losing them. \n  My vision is clouded in a red haze, the beast chastising me as a failure. I stumble and feel that I'm about to lose control. I'm tired, so I allow it. Yet just before I go unconscious, the beast reminds me that once again I gave up too easily.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2295A;When I awaken, I begin the long walk home, listening as the beast whispers my failures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2296;As I stand there catching my breath, I find myself a little confused. I failed to kill my foe, yet the beast within me is silent and apparently content. It was a good battle. One that left both my foe and I covered with various cuts, yet none that were serious. \n  I also am uncertain how long exactly we fought, although the moon has moved considerably from when we first began. I close my eyes and calm my breathing, listening to the silence that is slowly ending as the bugs and animals that live in the night come out of hiding. I listen, confirming that the beast is indeed content, and I relax. Not the best hunt, yet far from the worst.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2296A;I return home, enjoying the soothing light of the moon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2297;I'm bleeding. I took a serious hit, and failed to bring down my foe, leaving me struggling from both the wound and the howling beast within that is mocking me for my defeat. \n  I ignore it to the best of my ability, focusing on my wound as I put distance between the point of battle. The only positive being that my foe may have been wounded as well, for they didn't pursue me as I withdrew. \n  When I finally know I'm safe, it becomes harder to block out the howling rage. Soon, the red haze is upon me. I try to push it back, yet my wound has sapped my strength. Soon, I feel conscious fade as the beast takes my body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2297A;When I awaken, I begin the long walk home where I can tend to my wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2298;I'm bleeding and broken. I took a serious beating, and failed to bring down my foe, leaving me with a maimed body and the howling beast within that is mocking me for my defeat. \n  I ignore it to the best of my ability, focusing on my wound as I put distance between the point of battle. The only positive being that my foe may have been wounded, for they didn't pursue me as I withdrew. \n  When I finally know I'm safe, it becomes harder to block out the howling rage. Soon, the red haze is upon me. I try to push it back, yet my broken body has sapped my strength. Soon, I feel conscious fade as the beast takes my body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2298A;When I awaken, I begin the long, slow walk home where I can tend to my wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2291;It was a good hunt. My foe fell to my superior skill. It was a worthy kill, with the beast giving an almost satisfied growl before it's voice subsided. \n  I stand tall and give a victorious howl to the moon, in recognition of her blessing the field of battle with her illumination. Not every battle ends with my being unscathed, yet this one was masterful and my leaving without a wound is a testament to the night having shown me favor in recognition of my talent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2291A;I return home having proven myself with a successful hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2292;It was a good hunt. My foe fell to my superior skill after making a worthwhile showing of skill. It was a worthy kill, with the beast giving an almost satisfied growl before it's voice subsided. \n  I stand tall and give a victorious howl to the moon, in recognition of her blessing the field of battle with her illumination. Although I walk away with a wound, it was still an excellent battle between two individuals seeking to end the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2292A;I return home having proven myself with a successful hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2293;It was a good hunt. My foe fell to my superior skill after almost staging an upset that managed to leave me maimed. It was a worthy kill, with the beast giving an almost satisfied growl before it's voice subsided. \n  I do my best to stand tall and give a victorious howl to the moon, in recognition of her blessing the field of battle with her illumination. Before hobbling away with my battered body, I give one last acknowledging nod to my fallen foe who fought valiantly enough to have almost turned the tide in their favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2293A;I return home having proven myself with a successful hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2201;I don't believe the little Red Sisterhood hunter was expecting me to charge forth and engage her. I seem to have caught her off guard and I'm clearly driving her backwards. \n  She is skilled though, and she is doing her best to not be overwhelmed. While the beast within seems interested in playing with her, I can tell by her movements that given a chance, she may be able to turn the tide and make this very dangerous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2201A;I press on while I've the advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2201B;It is too risky, I wait for an opening and flee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2201C;Perhaps it wouldn't hurt to play with her, and those lips.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2202;The little Red Sisterhood hunter is clearly skilled as she isn't surprised by willingness to move forward and engage her. After a flurry of strikes, blocks, sidesteps and counters, it's clear that she is skilled and this is a battle that can go either way. \n  Her body language changes, clearly showing that she's done measuring my skill as well, and the glint in her eye clearly indicates that she feels she can take me. I shake my head as the beast within seems interested in playing with her, which could be very dangerous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2202A;I press on, determined to win the battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2202B;It is too risky, I wait for an opening and flee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2202C;Perhaps it wouldn't hurt to play with her, and those lips.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2203;The little Red Sisterhood hunter presses me immediately, putting me on the defensive and making it difficult to keep up with her assault. I lose a little fur as her flurry of strikes seems to be honing in on me. It's clear that she is skilled and this is a battle that can go poorly for me unless I turn it around. \n  She seems to sense I'm on the edge as she redoubles her assault, the glint in her eye clearly indicates that she feels she can take me. I growl in annoyance as I'm faced with turning tail or turning the tide in my favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2203A;I press on, determined to turn the tide of battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2203B;It is too risky, I wait for an opening and flee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2204;She is more than I can handle, so I flee. As fast as my body will carry me. She gives pursuit, and its maddening. I attempt to change directions and a silver tipped bolt slams into me. I falter, and in my fear, the beast gains hold. I'm washed away in a red haze as I sense the fear of the beast pushing me forward, ignoring the wound as I lose conciousness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2204A;I'm thankful to awaken. Still alive, I make my way home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2205;She realizes too late what my intentions are, as I tear her top off. Her eyes go wide in shock and her guard drops, allowing me to strike her soundly. Dazed, I toss aside her weapons and grip her head in my clawed hand. \n  As her eyes try to focus, my cock slaps across her face. She opens her mouth to object, and I take the opening to shove my dick in. Her jaw strains from my girth and I feel a shudder ripple through me as the beast within expresses excitement. \n  Holding her head, I fuck her throat, her eyes bulging and her mouth making muffled attempts for air. I feel her body weaken as she's devoid of air and it sets me off. With a howl I fill her throat with me seed. Pulling out she gasps for air as my semen dribbles out of her mouth. Satisfied, I look down at the little huntress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2205A;I'll leave her alive, with the taste of my seed to remember me by.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2205B;I don't leave threats alive and tear out her throat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf4040;How advantageous. A local merchant had a rare pure moonstone. For a reasonable price, I now have the materials for a Ceremony of the Moon. \n  As I'm grinding up the stone, I do my best to ignore the voice of the Beast within me. It's telling me that I'm wrong, that the moonstone isn't pure and as such will doom me for insulting Mother Moon. I know it's scared, as the ritual was once the most common way for elders of my kind to resist the lure of the beast. Alas, the rarity of pure moonstones became an issue, and it was discovered that impure moonstones could free the beast. \n  Once the stone is ground, I wait for nightfall, and then under the illumination of the moon, I speak the ritual, giving thanks to the moon as it watches over us, finally blowing the dust into the night air.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf4040A;Thanks be to Mother Moon's purifying light.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2140;I head out in search of wildlife to claim as my prey. As I'm hunting, I catch sight of a magnificent stag in the distance. A fine creature that would be a great feast, while it's horns would make a fine trophy. \n  I set out towards him, making a point to keep my scent downwind and remain out of his line of sight to the best of my abilities. It's lively, moving regularly as though it still senses me nearby. This will be a little more difficult than a normal deer. \n  After almost an hour, I'm close enough to begin planning how to best take down this impressive animal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2140A;I use tactics to corner and finish my prey;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2140B;I use stealth to stalk and ambush my prey;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2140C;I hunt my prey to the best of my abilities;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2150;I'm tracking what looks like a good size boar based on the tracks. A fine beast to fulfil the my need for the hunt. Hearing movement in the brush ahead, I crouch low and get ready to spring. \n  The boar that comes out of the brush is indeed a large one, and I immediately realize that I may have underestimated it, as it catches my scent and instead of running, it turns towards me and stamps it's hoof in a challenge. I notice it's head bears impressive scars of previous conflict which it obviously survived. \n  As I consider the large boar, it gives another snort and prepares to charge me itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2150A;I push down the urge to flee and prepare to face the scarred boar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2150B;I shall defeat my prey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2150C;I've no desire to risk serious injury and withdraw.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2193;While rare, a wildlife hunt does involve risks. Some of nature's creatures are capable warriors in their own right, and then there are those who through age and natures blessing have evolved into something more. \n  I'm grateful for the opportunity to have given such a magnificent beast a challenge. My only regret is failing to avoid its killing blow. As my blood pours from my cooling body, I offer my thanks for the challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2193A;My spirit moves on, while my body returns to the cycle of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2160;I'm following the trait of what looks to be a large boar, which seems to be the ideal hunt for me in terms of challenge and meat to feast upon. I'm soon in front of the patch of foliage that it's in. I freeze as I approach, as not only my senses, but even the beast within hesitates momentarily at the dangerous presence we feel. \n  As though it senses us in turn, a great creature lumbers out from the foliage. A large thick skinned boar, covered in various barbs with the scars of many victorious battles upon its flesh. A creature that some may refer to as a Dire Boar. \n  The beast within me has recovered and seems to be singing with the urge to face it, while my instincts warn me of the potential death that awaits me. I tense as I prepare my move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2160A;I put my life on the line as I charge forth to slay the Dire Boar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2160B;I recognize the death when I see it, so I flee as quickly as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2161;The battle is impressive. When I finally find myself standing over the Dire Boar's body, I'm surprised to find myself with only superficial damage. With a final spasm of defiance, the boar's body emits its final breath before finally going still. \n  The beast within me is silent, it's hunger sated by the glorious battle. It's then that I hear another voice, the instinctual whispers of Mother Moon, the Dire Bear offers a boon to those who defeat it. Rend the thick flesh to consume the still warm muscle underneath and obtain a measure of its strength, or meditate and open my senses as it passes and gain insight into the unique knowledge it has gathered over its many years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2161A;I consume the warm flesh, claiming its strength as my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2161B;I meditate, catching glimpses of its knowledge and insight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2162;The battle is impressive. When I finally find myself standing over the Dire Boar's body, I fall to my knees from fatigue and the wound that it gave me. With a final spasm of defiance, the boar's body emits its final breath before finally going still. \n  The beast within me is silent, it's hunger sated by the glorious battle. It's then that I hear another voice, the instinctual whispers of Mother Moon, the Dire Bear offers a boon to those who defeat it. Rend the thick flesh to consume the still warm muscle underneath and obtain a measure of its strength, or meditate and open my senses as it passes and gain insight into the unique knowledge it has gathered over its many years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2164;I leap away from the Dire Boar, and flee with every ounce of speed I can call forth. I can hear it pursuing, death charging after me as it barrels through the undergrowth. It's not until I reach a clearing by a farm that I realize the noise of pursuit as stopped. \n  I keep running, although now it's less from the Dire Boar and more from the howling fury within my head. I stumble, crashing to the ground and my consciousness fades to red as the beast within catches me. \n  I awaken the next morning, uncertain exactly where I am. After wandering for nearly an hour, I finally get my bearings and deduce the route back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2164A;I make my way back home, trying to ignore the stronger whispers within my head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2165;The battle with the Dire Boar does not end in my favor. I am still alive, but I'm wounded, while the Dire Boar still lives. Perhaps I should be thankful that I managed to wound it and drive it off as well, as I could be dead. \n  Besides having survived, another benefit is the beast seems satisfied by the battle, although as I make slow progress home, that somehow seems shallow. Almost as though I deserve it's mocking, rage inspired rantings for failing. \n  It is what it is, so I focus simply on making my way back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2165A;The Dire Boar will not be so lucky should we meet again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2166;The battle with the Dire Boar does not end in my favor. I am still alive, but I'm broken and battered after it maimed me. The Dire Boar itself still lives, yet I should be thankful that I managed to wound it and drive it off, for I could be dead if it pressed the situation. \n  Besides having survived, another benefit is the beast seems satisfied by the battle, although as I make slow progress home, that somehow seems shallow. Almost as though I deserve it's mocking, rage inspired rantings for failing. \n  It is what it is, so I focus simply on moving my broken body and making my way back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2166A;The Dire Boar will not be so lucky should we meet again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf1130;I set out for some of the most difficult targets to stalk. After several hours, I'm moving in on one of the adult werewolves. Seeing my chance, I leap out and land, emitting a victorious howl. The adult werewolf leaps up surprised. I watch it as a range of emotions wash over it's features, until it seems the adult has decided that it wishes some playful revenge. \n  The next couple hours are both fun and tiring as we chase each other and wrestle around. Giving the adult ample opportunity to show that I still have room for improvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf1130A;I shall become one of the greatest hunters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf4050;I relax as I watch the setting sun and the rising moon. Intent on meditating through the evening in an attempt to subdue the voices within. Just as I relax, my evening's plans come crashing down as the sound of a howl right behind me sends me leaping upward in surprise. \n  I turn and find a young werewolf, obviously pleased with themselves for having successfully sneaking up on me. I ponder an appropriate response, and decide that a little lesson is in order. Several hours of chasing the youth around and play wrestling, ends with us both being exhausted and in high spirits. I wave the youth to return home, while I notice in surprise myself that the beast within appears to have been subdued for the evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf4050A;While unplanned, it wasn't bad playing a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2310;I must act in order to calm the voice of the beast within, and one thing that the beast regularly calls for is an end to those who threaten me. I'm not without rivals, and tonight, I've decided that [dw_hunt_rival.GetBestName] shall no longer be a thorn in my side. \n  The challenge of course is that as my rival, they're well aware of the threat that I pose and as such will have resources in place to help protect them. Still, my mind is made up, so the only decision to make is how I should go about taking down my rival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2310A;I shall use diplomatic favors to lure my rival into facing me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2310B;I shall let nothing stand in my way as I move to face my rival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2310C;I shall infiltrate and ambush my rival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2310D;I shall end this rivalry to the best of my ability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2390;I'd like to say that my rival was a worthy opponent, however, I walk away from this unscathed and disappointed that such a weakling would dare consider to make themselves an enemy of me. The beast within though is satisfied in having a known threat dealt with. \n  Giving one last look to the mangled body that was a rival, I snort in disgust before bounding away into the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2390A;[dw_hunt_rival.GetBestName] is a threat no longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2391;My rival turned out to be a worthy opponent. While they have died by my own hands, [dw_hunt_rival.GetBestName] managed to wound me during the assault. The beast within is also satisfied in having a known threat dealt with. \n  Giving one last look to the mangled body that was a rival, I give a howl of admiration before bounding away into the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2391A;[dw_hunt_rival.GetBestName] is a threat no longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2392;My rival turned out to almost be more than I could handle. While they have died by my own hands, [dw_hunt_rival.GetBestName] managed to maim me during the assault. The beast within is also satisfied from both the battle and knowing a threat has been dealt with. \n  Giving one last look to the mangled body that was a rival, I give a howl of admiration before dragging my broken body away into the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2392A;[dw_hunt_rival.GetBestName] is a threat no longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2399;I underestimated my rival. I was certain that the time to strike them was clearly in my favor, and that I had the skill to come out on top. Alas, it is their blade that brings an end to my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWWerewolf2399A;May they burn in hell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
