#Event Descriptions
DWNight1009;Word has come to me of a bloody coup that has taken place, with a new person in power. In hearing what took place, I can only wonder what plans [From.GetBestName] may have in store for his neighbors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight1009A;What an interesting development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight1008;I've been notified that despite our attempts at preventing Fenris's escape, that he has managed to pull it off. I can only imagine what news of Fenris the coming days will bring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight1008A;This is not good news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight1006;We have successfully re-captured Fenris. The fool actually thought he may escape. It is in his best interest to not press his luck again with such an ill advised action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight1006A;No one escapes my prison.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight1007;I'm startled by a loud bang and the sound of yelling. Running to a nearby window, I see Fenris fleeing from a smouldering hole in the wall of my prison. \n  He's moving quickly, and so far people are just staring at him slack jawed as he is fleeing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight1007A;Let him go. He isn't worth the headache.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight1007B;Guards, guards! Stop him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight1007C;Commander [dw_commander.GetFirstName], stop him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight1110;This was released ahead of planned. You've been dominated by Fenris. He's made you his bitch, stuffing his engorged cock into me and railing away until fill me with an explosion of thick, gooey cum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight1110A;Oh shit! I'm a bitch and may be pregnant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight2009;Word has come to me of a bloody coup that has taken place, with a new person in power. In hearing what took place, I can only wonder what plans [From.GetBestName] may have in store for his neighbors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight2009A;What an interesting development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight2007;I'm awoken by the Captain of the Guard. There has apparently been a prison break. The details are so ludicrous that I have him repeat them twice. \n  A guard was found bled dry, withered, as though he had been dead for weeks. While no one say a person escape, it is said that a cloud of bats fled the prison. And while I then suspected the worse, it was confirmed when it was shared that my prisoner, Vladimir was no where to be found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight2007A;He turned into a cloud of bats? Seriously?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight10;Fenris stands before me, his aura is over powering causing my gaze to naturally lower so as to not appear challenging. \n  "You have served me and your brethren well [Root.GetFirstName]. I've challenged you to be the vanguard of our people as we emerge from the wilds to take our place over mankind. And you've already made great strides as you've risen to rule over your own lands. In the coming years, I too shall claim my own lands. Then together, we shall oust mankind and rule over them as their betters." \n  I feel my blood pound with joy at being recognized by Fenris. It is our time to rise. Mankind, vampires, and those who thought they chased us to the wilds shall now see our might. \n  Fenris says I shall hear from him again in the coming years, and that I'm to continue to grow in power in the meantime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight10A;I am honored to be the vanguard of our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight21;There was a new man who visited my court this week. Something about him demanded attention. When he offered to discuss matters of the realm, I could only agree. \n  What followed seems like a hazy blur. When we met, I saw not the burly man, but a large imposing werewolf before me. Somehow, I knew I was seeing his true form. Part of my mind screamed to resist, yet there was something in the air that locked me in place. \n  I expected to die right then and there. To be torn limb from limb and consumed. The werewolf grabbed me and tore at me with his claws, rending not flesh, but instead my clothing. \n  I was tossed to the ground, and as I looked up, it's member grew stiff before me. It was difficult to breath, and that unidentifiable scent grew stronger. \n  I was shown my place. I'm the lesser, an omega male.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight21A;I have accepted my role and shall strive to serve my masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight21B;Oh shit, this isn't what I wanted. No, no, no, no.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight25;There was a new man who visited my court this week. Something about him demanded attention. When he offered to discuss matters of the realm, I could only agree. \n  What followed seems like a hazy blur. When we met, I saw not the burly man, but a large imposing werewolf before me. Somehow, I knew I was seeing his true form, bold and masculine. A scent in the air seemed to make my knees weak, and I dropped to my knees as my breathing became ragged. \n  "What a good little bitch you are," said the werewolf as a large canine cock stiffened before me. I felt my mouth water, as he stepped closer. \n  I looked up into his fierce eyes and waited. After what seemed like an eternity, he nodded and I touched his shaft. It was warm, firm, and I soon found my lips wrapped around it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight25A;I have accepted my role and shall strive to serve my masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight25B;Oh shit, this isn't what I wanted. No, no, no, no.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight30;The shock of my incident has come to pass. I know not who my aggressor was, but judging by my current state, it must have been a vampire. Most confusing was why didn't I perish? \n  Do all that are drained rise as vampires? I've heard whispers that it's instead some kind of ritual, one which usually binds the victim to their creator. If this is the case, why do I not feel these bindings? Why has the one who turned me disappeared? \n  For several weeks I've pondered these questions while adapting and resuming my duties as a ruler. I must be careful. It's as though some can sense what I've become, and I've no desire to be taken by a monster hunter. For I am no monster. I am still myself, and I shall continue to rule while I adapt to this new life before me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight30A;With no master or teacher, my destiny is mine to shape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4000.0;I return to my chambers after a long day in court. Upon entering I find Rayne, blood dribbling down her chin, where it further drips upon her cleavage. There is blood sprayed all around my room, with no clear source, save a blackened husk that lays not far from her feet.\n  "Looks like someone was hoping to make a meal of you my [Root.GetLordLady]. I thought I picked up an unnatural scent, and I followed it here, where you had a visitor lurking in the shadows. Alas, they weren't expecting me."\n  I choke down urge to heave, and I wonder if it's from the sight of so much blood sprayed about my room or from watching Rayne smirk as she drinks from a cup that's filled with it.  I lean out of the door, calling for a servant to clean up the mess.\n  Turning back to Rayne, I ask if it's a vampire that she's familiar with, or if this is the sign of something more? With a sigh of disappointment, she shares that it didn't match the description of one she's hunting. It could be a progeny of one, but it wasn't willing to answer her questions. As far as being part of something larger, she's uncertain.\n  I hear the servant gasp behind me as they reach my doorway. Rayne smiles and slips out while I give the servant instructions on what I want cleaned up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4000.1;I return to my chambers after a long day in court. I grumble in annoyance at the lack of light, assuming that my servants are lacking in a simple responsibility of ensuring my chambers are properly lit.\n  I move to light a candle, when I feel a breeze, and the hairs on the back of my neck raise in warning. I turn towards the window, and I see a creature in the shadows. It's skin is sickly grey, with pupiless eyes that seem to reflect the light of the single candle flame that fights on. I feel it's will, demanding that I stay put as I see it emerge from the shadows, it's mouth, opening to display a row of distorted teeth, with hideously enlarged canines. I hear the blood in my body roar to life, and I take an audible breath, only then realizing that I wasn't breathing as it began to step towards me.\n  This creature is obviously a vampire, one which is here for me. I feel my adrenaline snapping whatever power it was using to try and hold me in place. The only question now, is how do I respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4000A;I'm grateful Rayne was here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4000B;I shall fight the creature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4000C;I shall run from the creature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4000D;I shall submit to the creature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4001.0;We continue to battle, each seeking to finish the other as our strikes just as intent as before, yet our ability to avoid getting hit is gone.\n  Grappling, we both muster the strength to press on, to land another blow. I try to growl in victory as I feel my strike land successfully, only to find myself gasping for air as my I myself am mortally wounded.\n  We both collapse. I flounder as I seek to somehow address my wound. Only to realize it's futile. I hear an odd crackling sound, and turn to see the vampire's flesh begin to fall to ash, leaving only bones behind. I'm about to die, yet at least I took that creature out with me. May those I've saved from its clutches bode well upon my final judgement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4001.1;I go to move, and my legs don't appear to get the message as I do little more than stumble. I will my legs to move as I try to catch my balance. The wounds I've taken is taking its toll and just when I think I've recovered, I feel it slam into me, taking me to the ground.\n  I try to roll with the tackle, seeking to get it off of me. I'm unsuccessful as it's grip appears to tighten and further limit my struggles.\n  I can smell the rotten stentch of its breath, feel it against the back of my neck. I want to scream, yet my lungs strain to breath. I don't want to die. Not like this.\n  Tears begin to whelm up in my eyes as I burn what strength I've left as I flail to try and get free. As if it senses I'm spent, I feel it's teeth as it bites down on me, and my world fades to black.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4001.2;Its movements have become sluggish. I sense an opening and I leap forward to strike. It hisses and seeks to recoil, yet finds its path blocked as it's cornered. I score a successful hit, sinking deep and the vampires eyes widen in surprise.\n  I don't relent, slamming my weight upon it to keep it pinned as I strike again, and again, and again.\n  I'm breathing hard, and it's difficult to move my arm any longer. It's then that I notice the vampire is limp, held up only by my body pressing against it. I stumble a bit as I step back and straighten up. Immediately, the creature crumples in a heap upon the ground. As I watch, it begins to smoke slightly as its flesh rots away into ash. Soon, leaving only bones and tattered clothing behind.\n  With a sigh, I collapse into a chair, calming myself before calling out to a servant. I'm going to need a drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4001.3;The vampire leaps at me, it's clawed hands reaching for me as it hisses. I barely get out of the way of its inhuman speed as it rakes me with its claws. I lash out myself, striking it's exposed side.\n  The creature howls with rage and with both exchange a flurry of strikes, with none doing any more additional damage than flesh woulds before we once again separate and circle each other.\n My damage taken [first_fighter.first_combat_damage.GetValue].\n Vampire's damage taken [second_fighter.second_combat_damage.GetValue].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4001.4;The vampire moves with an unnatural grace as it circles me. I move to put a piece of furniture between us, looking for means of getting in my own strike. The vampire doesn't give me the time to evaluate it.\n  With inhuman speed, it dashes towards me, moving around the obstacle between us in the blink of an eye. I try to deflect the blow, yet am unsuccessful as it's claws cut deeply into me. I stagger a bit and lash out, yet it's already gone.\n  It's hideous face seems to grin mockingly at me, as it once again resumes circling me.\n My damage taken [first_fighter.first_combat_damage.GetValue].\n Vampire's damage taken [second_fighter.second_combat_damage.GetValue].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4001.5;We move around, seeking an opening to strike out each other. The creature before me hissing and darting forward periodically with a probing slash.\n  I take a smaller step, letting the distance between us close just a bit more. The creature takes the bait as it lunges and swipes at me again. I lean back just slightly, it's strike falling just short of the mark. I then lunge forward myself and strike. I feel the blow hit soundly, and the vampire hisses and leaps back to put distance between us once again.\n  My damage taken [first_fighter.first_combat_damage.GetValue].\n Vampire's damage taken [second_fighter.second_combat_damage.GetValue].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4001.9;This description would ideally not be seen. If it is, a description flag failed somewhere. Regardless, you're still in the thick of things, and the fight continues.\n My damage taken [first_fighter.first_combat_damage.GetValue].\n Vampire's damage taken [second_fighter.second_combat_damage.GetValue].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4001A;The fight continues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4001B;Fatality!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4001C;I'm victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4001D;At least I took it with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4003.0;I waste no time and dart towards the door. I see it move inhumanly fast towards me, yet I dare not look its way, instead I will myself forward.\n  I reach the door, just a moment before it, where I feel it's claws try to snag my clothing. I turn into the corridor, pushing myself forward, calling for the guards as I seek to escape my attacker.\n  As I reach the end of the hall, I hear guards running towards me. I take a moment to glance back and I see the vampire stop and hesitate a moment. It hisses and I continue on towards the guards. While it looked like the creature was ready to leave, I see no reason to risk it with help so close by.\n  Upon reaching the guards, I quickly explain what I saw, and I follow them back to my room. The creature appears to be gone, with no sign of the intruder, save the open window and claw marks which slashed across a painting that hung beside the window.\n  I have extra guards posted nearby as I retire for the evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4003A;Where did the creature go to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4004.0;I dart towards the door, intent on getting away. I notice movement out of the corner of my eye and I steal a glance at it. I come to a halt and back pedal as it reaches the doorway before me. It moves towards me, it's inhuman eyes locked on mine.\n  I consider calling for help, yet seem unable to find my voice as it gets closer. My options are disappearing before me, and my time on this Earth is nearing an end. What shall I do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4004A;Fight;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4004B;Submit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4005.0;I don't desire the pain that would come from fleeing or fighting such a creature. I close my eyes and turn my head as I await the inevitable.\n  It's only a breath before I feel it's grip pull me from my feet. It pulls me and brings me down onto a couch with blinding speed. The force causes my breath to be knocked from my lungs. My eyes open, fear likely obvious as I gaze upon the pale mottled skin of my assailant.\n  As my lungs convulse to try and regain air, it turns my head and holds it firm. I can hear it hiss as it strikes. My neck is pierced, and I find my lungs no longer ache to take a breath. My eyes grow heavy as I can only hear the sickly wet sounds of the beast feeding upon me.\n  My eyes close, and soon even my hearing begins to fade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4005A;I slip into darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4006.0;My eyes snap open as the sound of a morning bird seems to echo through my room. I quickly shield them from the intense light that is coming in through a window. I stumble from the couch, sliding across the floor over into a corner of my room that still holds a shadow.\n  As I sit there, the overwhelming sensations begin to lessen. The songbird isn't as loud and sunlight itself is no longer blinding. I close my eyes and enjoy the cool corner as I wonder just how strong my hangover will be today.\n  With a sudden realization, I recall the events from last evening. The creature that stood before me, succumbing to the inevitable, the sickly sound of the creature feeding upon me...\n  I rub my neck, certainly it wasn't a dream. I'm covered with something. I scratch at what's on my neck and view my fingers to see flakes of dried blood upon them. I move over to the mirror, and gaze at my reflection. I've healed somehow, small dimpled scars all that remain of the wound. I lean forward to get a closer look, and only then notice I can see through myself while gazing in the mirror. As though my image has faded.\n  I'm alive somehow. Yet I must be careful. I must get cleaned and let no one know of what has happened to me, for I can feel that I've changed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4006A;I have become one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4100.0;I'm walking through the hallway, when [dw_vampire_seducer.GetFirstName] steps out before me.\n  "Good evening my [Root.GetLordLady]. I am so glad that we've crossed paths this evening. I find you very intriguing, and have been hoping for the opportunity to spend some time together. Would you care to join me for a while?"\n  [dw_vampire_seducer.GetFirstName] steps forward and traces her fingers down along one of my arms, all while staring into my eyes. I feel my pulse quicken, and clear my throat as I seek to give her invitation a response. Her red lips smile warmly, and her eyes almost appear to draw me in further. Finally finding my voice, I give my response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4100.1;I'm walking through the hallway, when [dw_vampire_seducer.GetFirstName] steps out before me.\n  "Good evening my [Root.GetLordLady]. I am so glad that we've crossed paths tonight. I must say that you are very intriguing, and I have been hoping for the opportunity to spend some time together. Would you care to join me for a while?"\n  [dw_vampire_seducer.GetFirstName] steps forward and traces his back of his fingers alongside my jaw, all while staring into my eyes. I feel my pulse quicken, and clear my throat as I seek to give his invitation a response. The pupils in his eyes appear to enlarge, as if to draw me in further. Finally finding my voice, I give my response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4100A;Sure, I've got time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4100B;Sorry, now isn't a good time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4100C;Sorry, I'm not homosexual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4101.0;Something about [dw_vampire_seducer.GetFirstName]'s eyes just won't allow me to look away.\n  "That's it, look into my eyes. Feel yourself submit to my will."\n  What is this feeling? Why can't I look away? Why do I even want to look away? Isn't it better to listen to what [dw_vampire_seducer.GetFirstName] has to say?\n  "That's it. Relax. I just want to spend some time with you. That's not bad is it?"\n  Fingers brush across my cheek. I wonder, why would I be asked if it's bad. Of course it's not bad. Why would I think it's bad?\n  "Good, good. Come, let's relax in your study. Who knows, perhaps you're the kind of person that likes to experiment?"\n  Experiment. Yes, that sounds good. I feel [dw_vampire_seducer.GetFirstName]'s breath on my neck as they lean close while we head to the study.\n  "Yes, this is nice. Now relax [Root.GetFirstName]. Relax, listen, and give into my will. Once I'm done, and I leave, forget I was here with you and awaken."\n\n  I find myself staring at the ceiling, reclining in my study. I rub my eyes as I sit up and try to recall when I dozed off. It must have been after court. It was a long day today afterall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4101A;I wonder if I'm getting sick?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4102.0;Something about [dw_vampire_seducer.GetFirstName]'s eyes just won't allow me to look away.\n  "That's it, look into my eyes. Feel yourself submit to my will."\n  What is this feeling? Why can't I look away? Why do I even want to look away? Isn't it better to listen to what [dw_vampire_seducer.GetFirstName] has to say?\n  "That's it. Relax. I just want to spend some time with you. That's not bad is it?"\n  Fingers brush across my cheek. I wonder, why would I be asked if it's bad. Of course it's not bad. Why would I think it's bad?\n  "Good, good. Come, let's relax in your study. We'll chat for a while and get to know each other better. There's no harm in that, right?"\n  A chat? Yes, that sounds good. I feel [dw_vampire_seducer.GetFirstName]'s breath on my neck as they lean close while we head to the study.\n  "Yes, this is nice. Now relax [Root.GetFirstName]. Relax, listen, and give into my will. Once I'm done, and I leave, forget I was here with you and awaken."\n\n  I find myself staring at the ceiling, reclining in my study. I rub my eyes as I sit up and try to recall when I dozed off. It must have been after court. It was a long day today afterall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4102A;Perhaps I'm stressed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4103.0;[dw_vampire_seducer.GetFirstName] seems to stare at me more intently, even taking another step towards me. I hold up a hand and exlaim again that I've not the time for them at the moment. I notice a range of emotions from surprise, to anger, and back to that odd leering look they initially had upon greeting me. I suddenly find their presence annoying, and I wave my hand dismissively towards them while instructing them to remove themselves from my path or else I'll have them removed with force.\n  [dw_vampire_seducer.GetFirstName]'s smile appears strained, yet they step aside and apologize before quickly moving away. I watch them for a few moments, and notice the that my blood is pumping, as though ready to fight. I turn and move along myself, somehow clearly knowing that our relationship shall be a contentious one.\n  With a sigh, I silently curse my day so far. I wasn't expecting to find a potential enemy at the end of the day, yet there is clearly something dangerous about them and I'll need to be wary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4103A;May there be no more surprises.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4105.0;I bring [dw_vampire_seducer.GetFirstName] to my study, where we will have the opportunity to relax and talk without being interrupted. Our conversations are enjoyable. Or at least I feel happy in speaking with [dw_vampire_seducer.GetFirstName], as I don't recall much of our topics. I just recall [dw_vampire_seducer.GetFirstName]'s eyes, so deep and inviting. And their lips, they seem to be so vivid as and smooth as they speak.\n  "Hahaha. My [Root.GetLordLady], could I have some more wine?"\n  I shake my head as I realize I didn't hear the initial request. With a chuckle, I fill our glasses once again. I notice that we're on our second bottle. Obviously, my dulled awareness is due to having drunk so much. I hand the wine glass over, and sit down once more. Soon, the conversation resumes, and once again I seem to get lost in [dw_vampire_seducer.GetFirstName]'s features.\n  I come to my senses again as [dw_vampire_seducer.GetFirstName] touches my cheek.\n  "I've had a great time. Perhaps we can do this again some time."\n  [dw_vampire_seducer.GetFirstName]'s eyes are so close, their lips so near. It seems it's time to say goodnight. Or is it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4105A;I enjoyed our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4105B;I lean in for a kiss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4106.0;[dw_vampire_seducer.GetFirstName] accepts my kiss. Her lips are amazing, as I feel like I'm floating among the clouds. Our kiss breaks as she moves down my neck, kissing and licking as she peels my clothing from me. I'm in ecstasy and able to do little more than pant and steady myself as my legs appear ready to collapse.\n  She leads me over to a couch and lays me across it, my naked body fully exposed before her. She removes her clothing. It's mezmerising how it just seems to slide off her body, as if her skin were as smooth as silk.\n  I tremble as she leans against me, caressing my body with her own, using her hands to explore, while breathing, licking, and nibbling around my neck and shoulders. It's as though she's stimulating every part of me at once.\n  It's so intense that I'm unable to do more than pant as she turns from exploring my body, to sliding a pair of fingers into my wet cunny. I can only manage a short shrill sound as her fingers find my secret spot. She begins furiously pounding away with her fingers, striking it over and over, sending wave after electric wave through my body. Her breath is on my neck, her teeth nibble at my flesh. The feeling is too much as I climax hard, convulsing from head to toe as if possessed.\n  It's too much. She laughes, as I struggle to keep my eyes open. I feel my consciousness slipping. I struggle to get out one last phrase before I succumb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4106.1;[dw_vampire_seducer.GetFirstName] accepts my kiss. Her lips are amazing, as I feel like I'm floating among the clouds. Our kiss breaks as she moves down my neck, kissing and licking as she peels my clothing from me. I'm in ecstasy and able to do little more than pant and steady myself as my legs appear ready to collapse.\n  I tremble as she touches my cock. Looking down, I gaze once more into her deep eyes. I cannot look away as takes my cock into her mouth. Her head bobs up and down on my cock, taking more and more in with each movement. Soon, she taking it all in, her eyes staring up at me the entire time.\n  My mind seems as though it's about to melt, for her gaze seems to not permit my release. My cock trembles and my balls ache, yet she continues to suck, lick, and stroke me. I plead for release, for her to give me what I need. I hear her then, even with my cock in her throat, it's as though her eyes communicate her thoughts to me. 'Cum'\n  I erupt in her mouth. I continue to cum, as she pulls my cock out, her eyes still locked on as she drinks it up as though a thirtsy man in a desert.\n  It's finally too much, as my knees give way. She laughes, as I struggle to keep my eyes open. I feel my consciousness slipping. I struggle to get out one last phrase before I succumb to sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4106.2;[dw_vampire_seducer.GetFirstName] accepts my kiss. His lips are amazing, strong yet soft as I feel like I'm floating lazily along a stream. Our kiss breaks as he moves down my neck, kissing and licking as he peels my clothing from my body. I'm in ecstasy and able to do little more than pant and steady myself as my legs appear ready to collapse.\n  He pushes me back onto a couch, my naked body fully exposed before him. He removes his clothing. It's mezmerising how it just seems to slide off his body, as if his skin were as smooth as silk. His form is enticing, lean, strong, and I can tell he finds my body pleasing.\n  I tremble as he leans against me, using his hands to explore, while breathing, licking, and nibbling from my neck down to my pussy. It's as though he's stimulating every part of me at once.\n  It's so intense that I'm unable to do more than pant as he turns from exploring my body, to focusing his tongue between my cunny and my clit. He slides one of his firm fingers into my mouth, and I suckle it with hunger. I can only manage a short shrill sound as his fingers slip into me. He begins finger banging me while feverously flicking his tongue across my clit. The feeling is too much as I climax hard, convulsing from head to toe as the feeling washes over me.\n  It's too much. He laughes, as I struggle to keep my eyes open. I feel my consciousness slipping. I struggle to get out one last phrase before I succumb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4106.3;[dw_vampire_seducer.GetFirstName] accepts my kiss. His lips are amazing, strong yet soft as I feel like I'm floating lazily along a stream. Our kiss breaks as he moves down my neck, kissing and licking as he peels my clothing from my body. I'm in ecstasy and able to do little more than pant and steady myself as my legs appear ready to collapse.\n  He pushes me back onto a couch, my naked body fully exposed before him. He removes his clothing. It's mezmerising how it just seems to slide off his body, as if his skin were as smooth as silk. His form is enticing, lean, strong, and I can tell he finds my body pleasing.\n  I tremble as he leans against me, using his hands to explore, while breathing and nibbling on my neck. His hands finally make their way down to my ass, where he squeezes my ass cheeks, kneading them with his fingers.\n  I tense as I feel his hardness against me. He bites my neck as he pushes forth. Like a kitten in its mother's grip, I'm unable to resist as he begins fucking my ass.\n  It's so intense that I'm unable to do more than pant with each thrust. He slides one of his firm fingers into my mouth, and I suckle it with hunger as he's banging me. The feeling is too much as I climax hard, my cock convulsing and shooting cum upon my stomach. After a few more moments, he pulls out and shoots his cum upon my belly as well, our semen mixing atop me.\n  It's too much. I struggle to keep my eyes open as sleep beckons. I struggle to get out one last phrase before I succumb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4106A;Best talk ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4106B;Please be my lover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4150.0;I slip into the hallway, taking care to be unseen. I slide along the shadows as I make my way down it towards [dw_vampire_seduction_target.GetFirstName], who has just themselves entered the hallway. As we get closer, I step out letting my footsteps be heard.\n [dw_vampire_seduction_target.GetFirstName] looks up, noticing me as I approach. I flash a warm welcoming smile and offer up a greeting. They respond in kind, but I can sense unease in them.\n  I make an offhand remark about the weather, the common topic that establishes a basic connection with an individual. After they respond in kind with an uninteresting observation about the weather, I share that I'm glad I've had the opportunity to bump into them this evening. Their unease waivers a bit, weakened by the simple dialog exchange we shared.\n  Now it's time to secure what I've come here for. I need to lure them away, where I can operate in peace, without the chance of interruption. I allow my warmest smile to grace my face as I make my pitch to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4150A;Look into my eyes. (Hypnotism);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4150B;I have urgent news for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4150C;Let's talk over some wine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4150D;Nevermind. I'll be going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4153.0;I feel my blood thunder through my body just before it begins to burn away. I consume my own vitality to emit my mental dominance upon [dw_vampire_seduction_target.GetFirstName], seeking the gap within their psyche were I can implement my will.\n  [dw_vampire_seduction_target.GetFirstName] takes a step back and shakes their head. I feel my probing mental grip tossed aside as well. Their eyes lock onto mine, and I can see their distain for me. They may not know what happened, but I can see it clearly in their eyes. I'm a danger to them. I drop my smile, and share that it is unfortunate that they don't appear to be in the mood to talk.\n  "It is late [Root.GetFirstName], and I fear I'm not in the mood for company. You'll have to excuse me."\n  I nod accordingly, as I hear footsteps approaching. No need to elevate this even further. I turn and leave, cursing their mental fortitude. Such a pity, they would have made a nice thrall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4153A;Bah, a new rival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4155.0;I drop carefully selected hints that I've an urgent need to speak with [dw_vampire_seduction_target.GetFirstName]. Words sculpted to stress some unknown importance that warrants further discussion. I smile reassuringly as I motion for us to move onto a more suitable location.\n  [dw_vampire_seduction_target.GetFirstName] takes a moment, clearly thinking about what I had said, their eyes searching for some kind of hidden intent. Finally the shake their head and hold up the hand. I can see it clearly in their eyes. [dw_vampire_seduction_target.GetFirstName] views me as dangerous. I give an innocent smile, and shrug. Sharing my observation that they don't appear to be in the mood to talk.\n  "It is late [Root.GetFirstName], and I fear I'm not in the mood for company. You'll have to excuse me."\n  I nod accordingly, as I hear footsteps approaching. No need to elevate this even further. I turn and leave, cursing their survival instinct for seeing through me. Such a pity, they would have made a nice thrall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4155A;Bah, a new rival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4157.0;I present a bottle of wine that I brought along and share that I was simply looking for someone to enjoy a drink and a conversation with, when I figured [dw_vampire_seduction_target.GetFirstName] would be the ideal person. I smile warmly and wave my hand, indicated we should go to sit and drink. I notice thought, that [dw_vampire_seduction_target.GetFirstName] wrinkles their brow as they consider the offer.\n  "I apologize [Root.GetFirstName], but I think I'll have to pass on the offer tonight. It's been a long day, and I've need to arise early in the morning. I'll have to ask that you forgive me for not being able to join you for the drink."\n  I consider pushing the point further, yet I heard footsteps approaching, and decide that it's best to leave things well enough for now. At least [dw_vampire_seduction_target.GetFirstName] doesn't appear to suspect anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4157A;Perhaps next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4160.0;[dw_vampire_seduction_target.GetFirstName] looks into my eyes and I feel my blood thunder through my body just before it begins to burn away. I consume my own vitality to emit my mental dominance upon [dw_vampire_seduction_target.GetFirstName], seeking the gap within their psyche were I can implement my will.\n  [dw_vampire_seduction_target.GetFirstName]'s eyes glaze over, clearly devoid of any independant thought. I hook my arm through theirs and lead them to a nearby room, where the door can be closed and some additional privacy gained. Certain that we weren't seen, I look over [dw_vampire_seduction_target.GetFirstName]. What exactly shall I do with you I wonder?\n  I can spend some time to work on shaping your mind, making you more suitable to become a potential thrall in the future. Lowering your cunning or intellect, weakens the mind. And unfortunately a weak mind is necessary when creating a thrall.\n  Of course, I could opt to have a bite instead. It won't weaken their mind towards becoming a thrall, but it will create a temporary bond. Where [dw_vampire_seduction_target.GetFirstName] will view me more favorably for about a month. That in itself could have uses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4160A;Weaken their cunning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4160B;Weaken their intellect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4160C;Have a bite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4170.0;[dw_vampire_seduction_target.GetFirstName] falls for my lure as they believe I hold urgent news for them. We move from the hallway to a room, where I close the door in order to help keep things private. [dw_vampire_seduction_target.GetFirstName] paces as they anxiously await my words.\n  I turn on my charm, while weaving a tale of concern regarding potential threats, and how I'm a concerned person, who could be a potential ally. It takes a couple hours, of verbal maneuvering to get [dw_vampire_seduction_target.GetFirstName] into a trance like state, where my words have the opportunity to erode at their mental strength. I leave a few final snippets, seeking to plant a seed which will shape them as I desire.\n  I clear my throat, and awareness returns back to [dw_vampire_seduction_target.GetFirstName]'s eyes. I thank them for their time, and bid them good night before returning home for the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4170A;May my manipulation bear fruit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4180.0;[dw_vampire_seduction_target.GetFirstName] accepts my offer for a drink and a chat. We move from the hallway to a room, where I close the door in order to help keep things private. [dw_vampire_seduction_target.GetFirstName] is making small talk as I pour our drinks. Offering the drink to them, I hold mine aloft and toast the moment. I notice [dw_vampire_seduction_target.GetFirstName] hesitate, so I consume my drink to erase any doubts of it being poison. They raise their glass in return and relax as we begin to talk about several different topics.\n  I keep the drinks flowing for [dw_vampire_seduction_target.GetFirstName], while nursing mine. As the evening stretches on, [dw_vampire_seduction_target.GetFirstName] is clearly feeling the effects of the wine. With them in a malleable state, I begin to ehude my charm and will. Seeking to plant my words where they have the opportunity to erode at their mental strength. With the evening drawing to a close, I leave a few final snippets, seeking to plant a seed which will shape them as I desire.\n  I thank them for their time, and bid them good night before returning home for the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4180A;May my manipulation bear fruit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4200.0;I'm relaxing after a long day in court, when I feel a breeze blow through the room. I turn to look towards the window, and I see I've a visitor. It's [dw_vampire_feeder.GetFirstName] and I can tell by the hunger in [dw_vampire_feeder.GetHerHis] eyes exactly why they're here to see me tonight. I find that I can't turn away from their gaze as they flow across the room towards me.\n  [dw_vampire_feeder.GetFirstName] flows around me, sliding my clothing around to show my neck and shoulder. "Beautiful," [dw_vampire_feeder.GetSheHe] whispers, their breath sending tingles through my body as it brushes my neck.\n  I feel the quick pain, like a sharp pinch, which quickly disappears as a euphoric feeling washes over me. I hear myself moan while [dw_vampire_feeder.GetFirstName] feeds upon me.\n  I'm uncertain how much time has passed by, yet I see [dw_vampire_feeder.GetFirstName] standing over me know. Seemingly satisfied that I still breath, they turn and glide away as I myself fall into a deep slumber.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4200A;I sleep deeply tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4210.0;It's been a long day in court, and I have a hunger that normal food or drink will quench. I must have blood, and I know just who to visit tonight. I move swiftly, quietly through the shadows until I reach [dw_vampire_target.GetFirstName]'s room. I slip and observe them for a moment as they relax in a chair. I step forward to make my presence known, and [dw_vampire_target.GetFirstName] gives a little gasp of surprise. Our eyes lock and [dw_vampire_target.GetSheHe] knows why I'm here tonight.\n  I move across the room, our gaze never breaking. [dw_vampire_target.GetFirstName] even lifts their head slightly, showing me their precious neck. I move around them, tracing my fingers along their chin, their neck, their shoulder. I pull away their clothing, giving me a clear view. I can hear their blood pounding, calling out to me.\n  I bite [dw_vampire_target.GetFirstName]. Sinking my fangs and drawing upon the life blood that flows from their neck. They moan and slowly go limp, their body overcome by my presence and the sedative within my saliva. I drink until my hunger is appeased. I then lick the wound, mixing blood with saliva to staunch the flow and to heal it where my visit isn't obvious without close inspection.\n  [dw_vampire_target.GetFirstName]'s eyes are heavy. They're falling asleep, with a euphoric smile on their face as I decide to leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4210A;Delicious as always.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4300.0;I'm relaxing in my study when [dw_vampire_master.GetFullName] stops by unexpectedly. I'm not really in the mood for company, yet something about [dw_vampire_master.GetFirstName] keeps me from being able to utter my feelings. [dw_vampire_master.GetFirstName] smiles as [dw_vampire_master.GetSheHe] comes towards me.\n  "Hello [Root.GetFirstName], I think it's about time. Don't you?"\n  I'm uncertain what exactly is being asked, yet I find myself nodding in agreement. [dw_vampire_master.GetFirstName]'s eyes are intense as they look into me. It's almost as though they're glowing, pulsing with energy. They're so beautiful. I really like it when those eyes hold me like they are right now.\n  I feel [dw_vampire_master.GetFirstName]'s hand caress my chin before angling it up towards them. A finger is slide into my mouth, it has a slightly metallic taste, blood I'm certain. How wonderful. I never expected [dw_vampire_master.GetFirstName] to share something so vital with me. It's all too soon when they finally pull their finger from my mouth.\n  "There we are. You're such a good little pet. Now, who's your master?"\n  I nod and reply that they are, while wondering why I'm being asked such an odd question. Who else would I view as my master?\n  I'm disheartened when [dw_vampire_master.GetSheHe] leaves. It's like a part of me is now empty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4300A;Sleep is restless tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4310.0;It's time. I've need of a new thrall and [dw_vampire_target.GetFullName] shall become mine tonight. I wait until the right moment and slip into their chambers when they're alone. I see the shock in their eyes at my appearing before them, but no words escape their mouth as I trigger my ability to mentally dominate them. I smile as I watch their jaw go slack. Moving over towards them, I admire my soon to be pet.\n  Keeping our eyes locked and my domination on, I pierce one of my fingers with a fang, causing a drop of blood to pool upon it. I slide my finger into [dw_vampire_target.GetFirstName]'s mouth, where they begin to suck upon it. Cleaning the blood off my finger. I feel my presence within them, and as such, I bind their will to mine.\n  I pull my finger from my new pet's mouth, leaving them suckling the air for a moment. I see sadness in their eyes, which I dispel by complimenting them on being such a good pet. I enjoy their docile servitude a bit longer before deciding to call it a night. Leaving them behind to allow the binding to take hold for the evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4310A;I have a new pet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4401.0;I'm visited by my master tonight. I'm very pleased to see [dw_vampire.GetHerHer] and judging by the smile on [dw_vampire.GetFirstName]'s face, they're glad to see me.\n  "You've been a good pet [Root.GetFirstName]. I think it's time to reward you. Come here, it's time to make you one of us."\n  I tremble in anticipation at my master's words as I move forward. I lift my head up, offering my neck to them.\n  I feel my master's teeth sink in, and feed. Drawing blood from my body with a hunger that I never felt before. My vision begins to blur, not because of euphoria, but because my life is being drained from me.\n  I'm moving. Falling? No. I think I'm being held. I can't open my eyes.\n  "Drink."\n  I feel something cold press against my lips and I drink. I drink with a building hunger as I feel energy return to my body. I grip what's at my mouth, it's an arm. My eyes try to focus, and soon I realize it's my master... no. It's not my master. It's the arm of my sire.\n  "There, there. You've had enough. It's time for you to rest. Your body will be going through some changes tonight. Parts of it will be painful, yet tomorrow you'll feel renewed."\n  I feel the well of energy cut off as [dw_vampire.GetFirstName] withdraws [dw_vampire.GetHerHis] arm. My limbs are heavy, as are my eyes. I feel a sleep coming to take me. Before I drift off though, I cannot help but smile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4401A;I am reborn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4403.0;I'm visited by [dw_vampire.GetFirstName] while relaxing with some wine. Something about them seems different tonight. A look in their eyes, a look as though they're uncertain. I motion for them to have a seat, and inquire as to if all is well.\n  "Good evening [Root.GetFirstName]. I've a proposition for you. I find that I'm lonely. Lonely for one who can truly appreciate the life that I lead. [Root.GetFirstName], would you be willing to submit yourself to me, so that I may gift you the blessing of vampirism?"\n  I'm speechless. I wasn't expecting such an offer. First of all, regardless of past interactions, to hear them openly acknowledge that they're a vampire is either brave or insane. And then, based on the uncertainty in their eyes, I can tell that they won't be surprised if I say no.\n  I can accept this. I can politely decline the offer. Or I can seek to expose and make an enemy of [dw_vampire.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4403A;I accept your gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4403B;No thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4403C;Vile creature! Begone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4411.0;I've decided that its time to sire another vampire. After some consideration, I've selected [dw_vampire_target.GetFullName] to have the honor. I choose a time to appear before them, when no one can interrupt us.\n  [dw_vampire_target.GetFirstName] is happy as always to see me. I stroke their head, a master to its slave. A bond that will change when this is over.\n  I inform [dw_vampire_target.GetFirstName] of what is about to happen. Tears of joy fall from [dw_vampire_target.GetHerHis] eyes. I stroke their neck and they lift their chin in anticipation.\n  I latch on, with a ferociousness that they are unaccustomed with. The reason is lost on them, as I seek to drain them nearly dry. I've a time limit, one that requires me to take them near death, and then to feed them my own blood. Such necessity results in a violent union.\n  I can hear their heart slowing, struggling to continue. It's time. I gash my wrist with a fang, and then press it upon their mouth. I command them to drink, waiting to see if they've the life, the will within them to live on. They do have the will.\n  They drink my blood slowly at first, with an urgency, a hunger increasing as the drink. They grip my arm and draw from my strength. I feel lightheaded, which means it's time for them to stop. I pull my arm away, and they weaken visibly. I help them to bed, cover them and warn them of the pains that will come with the changes tonight. Unable to do more, I leave them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4411A;I am pleased with this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4413.0;I've decided that its time to sire another vampire. After some consideration, I've decided that I shall extend the offer of vampirism to [dw_vampire_target.GetFullName]. After careful prepartions to meet with them alone so no one can interrupt us, I soon find myself before them.\n  [dw_vampire_target.GetFirstName] seems to understand that my presence is more then a typical visit. After an initial exchange of pleasantries I decide to get to the matter at hand, as I can sense the risk of things getting awkward if I wait any longer.\n  I lay it out for them. That I'm a vampire, which they may already have known or at least suspected, and I wish for them to join my as one.\n  They stand and pace for a moment, taking in what was said. [dw_vampire_target.GetFirstName] turns towards me, meets my gaze, and gives me their response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4413A;What shall be their decision?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4415.0;[dw_vampire_target.GetFullName] accepts my offer to become a vampire. I explain that parts of it will be uncomfortable, yet the discomfort shall pass.\n  I instruct them to look into my eyes, deeply into them. [dw_vampire_target.GetFirstName] complies and willingly allows me to suppress their conscious, putting them into a near dream-like state as I embrace them.\n  I latch on with a ferociousness due to the need for me to drain them nearly dry. I've a time limit, one that requires me to take them near death, and then to feed them my own blood. Such necessity results in a violent union, and their state of delirium removes potential struggle that could complicate things.\n  I can hear their heart slowing, struggling to continue. It's time. I gash my wrist with a fang, and then press it upon their mouth. I command them to drink, waiting to see if they've the life, the will within them to live on.\n  They drink my blood slowly at first, with an urgency, a hunger that increases as the drink. They grip my arm and draw from my strength. I feel lightheaded, which means it's time for them to stop. I pull my arm away, and they weaken visibly. I help them to bed, cover them. Reminding them of the pains that will come with the changes tonight. Unable to do more, I leave them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4415A;I am pleased with this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4417.0;[dw_vampire_target.GetFullName] seems to weigh what I've said when they finally give a measured response.\n  "I fear I must reject your present offer [Root.GetFirstName], as I'm just not ready for the risks that would be involved. Perhaps in the future, yet for now, I mush respectfully decline."\n  Disappointing to be certain, yet it's clear that they at least considered it fairly. I'm also pleased that their body language shows that they aren't disgusted by me, which is a risk when clearly exposing myself as a vampire.\n  With a weary resignation, I bid [dw_vampire_target.GetFirstName] a good night as I leave them behind to further contemplate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4417A;Perhaps they'll come around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4419.0;[dw_vampire_target.GetFullName] rejects my offer, and even seems to sneer in disgust at being offered the chance to leave their humanity behind. I see to encourage them of the benefits that comes with being a vampire, yet it's clear their mind is made up. With a warning to never make such an offer to them again, they leave room without looking back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4419A;I've got a bad feeling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5500.0;It's a crisp night air. The kind of evening where it seems like my senses are sharper than normal. I pull in a deep breath, letting the night air fill me.\n  In that moment of lucid reflection, I feel a disturbance in the air around me. My eyes snap open as I leap and spin, narrowly avoiding a pair of blades that sought to end me. I suppress the questions that want to be answered, and I pull my own blade as I face my aggressor.\n  She moves slowly as her eyes remain locked on mine. She's coiled like a cat, ready to pounce. Then, incredible speed, she leaps forward and we clash. My blade manages to turn hers away. She hisses, baring her fangs. Angry that her prey is obviously not cooperating.\n  A vampire assassin? That explains some questions while raising others. She leaps again, our blades meet again, and I then feel her impressive strength. I deflect the blow again, but she manages to sink and elbow into my cheek.\n  Her elbow, it was warm. My senses flair and find a heart pumping full of life within my assailant. Ah. Not an vampire assassin, but a Dhampir. A half-vampire monster hunter. This could be dangerous...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5500.1;The moon is large tonight, although it must work to penetrate the clouds filling the night sky.  I close my eyes and take in the Moon's radiance. Her rays are purifying, causing the beast to retreat into a quiet slumber within me.\n  A shadow interrupts sensation, and I hear a disturbed growl from the beast within me. I open my eyes and find a crimson haired woman, garbed in combat leathers and wielding a pair of bloodied blades standing on a wall before me. Her eyes are weighing, judging me.\n  "I've no quarrel with you hound. My prey was a vampire. Your scent merely caught my attention so I came to have a look."\n  My nostrils flair as I take in her scent. She masks it, yet her recent activities have weakened its effect. A Dhampir stands before me. Monster Hunters, although they typically hunt their non-human lineage. Her posture doesn't change. Ready, yet not threatening. She's obviously awaiting my reaction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5500.2;It's a crisp night air. The kind of evening where it seems like my senses are sharper than normal. I pull in a deep breath, letting the night air fill me.\n  In that moment of lucid reflection, I hear someone moving quietly nearby... Above and behind me. My eyes snap open as I leap and spin, expecting an attack as I land, ready to draw my own blade.\n  It's a crimson haired woman, dressed in leathers, with blades covered in blood. Her scent seems familiar. She grins at me, and then I realize why it seems familiar.\n  "Well it's not everyday I see another Dhampir like I."\n  I don't drop my guard, remaining poised to move, until the woman herself relaxes. With an audible sigh, I stand and relax myself. Her smirk seems to remain, as her eyes continue to watch me. I motion towards her blades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5500.3;I stand outside, enjoying the cool night breeze, and appreciating the warm glow of the moon spreading over the year. It's relaxing evenings like this that help the burdens of a day in court melt away.\n  Motion catches my attention, as I look up behind me to see a crimson haired woman, clad in leathers, with blades still covered in blood. I consider calling for guards until my eyes meet hers and I feel my voice hold for just a moment.\n  "Hold. I likely have no quarrel with you. You're the ruler of these lands, yes?"\n  I nod in affirmation.\n  "Be aware, I've slain a vampire in your lands. I now hunt for any thralls that may have assisted it."\n  I find myself thinking briefly that perhaps court today was a little less stressful than standing before some vampire hunter. I feel her eyes piercing me, so I give a shrug and answer her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5500A;I must defend myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5500B;I've no reason to pick a fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5500C;I was in the mood for a fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5500D;I am no vampire's thrall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5500E;Looks like you've been busy tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5501.0;We clash again. Our strikes just as intent as before, yet our ability to parry and dodge is gone.\n  We each take strikes, yet this time, our legs don't listen and we're unable to separate to continue our dance. Leaning against each, slowly sliding to the ground, we both put in the remaining strength to push our blades in all the way.\n  We collapse, both devoid of enough blood to keep us moving. She chuckles a bit before the life fades from her eyes. It's then my turn to chuckle, for I may be about to die, but she left this world first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5501.1;I go to move, and my legs don't appear to get the message as I do little more than stumble. I will my legs to move as I try to catch my balance. My blood loss is taking its toll and just when I think I've recovered, I feel her boot slam into the side of my knee.\n  My leg buckles, the knee clearly destroyed. I fall forward and snarl in defiance, slashing as I roll over.\n  The bitch kicks the blade from my hand and the sticks me with one of her accursed blades. I must get away.\n  I begin crawling away. I hear the bitch chuckling, and then her boot on me, pinning me to the ground. *SCHTUNK*...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5501.2;Her movements have become sluggish. I sense an opening and I leap forward to strike. She screams as she whirls to try and take me, but she only cuts air as I stopped short, just outside of her reach.\n  Her slash was all that she had left though, and it's left her exposed and unbalanced. I dart forward, ready to strike before she can get her guard back in place.\n  With a growl of victory, I sink my blade to its hilt. Her arms go limp, and her eyes look up at me in shock, before the spark of life fades from them.\n  I pull my blade out, and let her body crumple on the floor. Pity, she's lost so much blood that trying to feed on her would be like trying to lick out scraps left behind in a porridge bowl. This little dhampir bitch just had to come and mess with my night.\n  With a sigh, I wipe my blade clean and return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5501.3;I mix it up with my ambusher as we both circle, slash and dodge while looking for an opening. She's strong and experienced. Regardless, I also have skills of my own, and as I rush forward, our blades clash in the night air. Instead of disengaging, I instead press forward while moving towards her side, she turns to meet me, while I quickly double-back and slash, scoring a successful strike.\n My damage taken [first_fighter.first_combat_damage.GetValue].\n Bloodrayne's damage taken [second_fighter.second_combat_damage.GetValue].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5501.4;This isn't the way it's supposed to be. I'm a hunter, not prey. I move warily, seeking an opening in my ambusher's defences. She's strong and experienced. Regardless, I also have skills of my own, and I lash out, seeking to land a blow. My blade only catches air, and I realize too late that I fell for a feint, as she slashes back and her blade bites into me. I hiss as I draw back, giving myself some space.\n My damage taken [first_fighter.first_combat_damage.GetValue].\n Bloodrayne's damage taken [second_fighter.second_combat_damage.GetValue].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5501.5;Our eyes lock, as the blood lust between us is almost tangible in the air. With a growl, we leap towards each other, and clash in a flurry of strikes. The exchange is intense, and I growl in victory as I feel my strike connect.

DWNight5501B;Fatality!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5501C;I'm victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5501D;At least I took the bitch with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5502.0;We clash again. Our strikes just as intent as before, yet our ability to parry and dodge is gone.\n  We each take strikes, yet this time, our legs don't listen and we're unable to separate to continue our dance. Leaning against each, slowly sliding to the ground, she puts her remaining strength to push her blades in all the way in, while I bear down with my bite on her neck, until I hear an audible crack.\n  We collapse, both devoid of enough blood to keep us moving. She wheezes a bit before the life fades from her eyes. I feel the beast within me, proud of the victory, yet unaware that we too are dying. I let out a guttural chuckle, for I may be about to die, but she left this world first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5502.1;I go to move, and my legs don't appear to get the message as I do little more than stumble. I crouch to all fours as I try to catch my balance. My blood loss is taking its toll and just when I think I've recovered, I feel her boot slam into the side of my knee.\n  My leg buckles, the knee clearly destroyed. I fall forward and snarl in defiance, slashing as I roll over.\n  The bitch kicks my other leg from under me and the sticks me with one of her accursed blades. I must get away.\n  I begin crawling away. I hear the bitch chuckling, and then her boot on me, pinning me to the ground. *SCHTUNK*...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5502.2;Her movements have become sluggish. I sense an opening and I leap forward to strike. She screams as she whirls to try and take me, but she only cuts air as I stopped short, just outside of her reach.\n  Her slash was all that she had left though, and it's left her exposed and unbalanced. I dart forward, ready to strike before she can get her guard back in place.\n  With a growl of victory, I sink my claws into her flesh. Her arms go limp, and her eyes look up at me in shock, before the spark of life fades from them.\n  I rip my claws out, and let her body crumple on the floor. Her tainted blood curls my nose, and I give her lifeless form a final kick.\n  This makes one less monster hunting bitch to plague my kind. With a grunt of finality, I turn and return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5502.3;I mix it up with my ambusher as we both circle, slash and dodge while looking for an opening. She's strong and experienced. Regardless, I fear no hunter. I rush forward and we clash in the night, our strikes a blur in the night air. I press forward while moving towards her side, she turns to meet me, while I quickly double-back and slash, scoring a successful strike.\n My damage taken [first_fighter.first_combat_damage.GetValue].\n Bloodrayne's damage taken [second_fighter.second_combat_damage.GetValue].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5502.4;This isn't the way it's supposed to be. I'm a hunter, not prey. I move warily, seeking an opening in my ambusher's defences. She's strong and experienced. Regardless, I will not be intimidated. I lash out, seeking to land a blow. My claws only catch air, and I realize too late that I fell for a feint, as she slashes back and her blade bites into me. I hiss as I draw back, giving myself some space.\n My damage taken [first_fighter.first_combat_damage.GetValue].\n Bloodrayne's damage taken [second_fighter.second_combat_damage.GetValue].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5502.5;Our eyes lock, as the blood lust between us is almost tangible in the air. With a growl, we leap towards each other, and clash in a flurry of strikes. The exchange is intense, and I growl in victory as I feel my strike connect. The victory is short lived though, as I take a hit myself before I'm able to fully disengage.\n My damage taken [first_fighter.first_combat_damage.GetValue].\n Bloodrayne's damage taken [second_fighter.second_combat_damage.GetValue].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DWNight5502C;I'm victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5502D;At least I took the bitch with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5503.0;I make it clear that I've no quarrel, and no desire to ruin the evening with a meaningless battle. She let's out a sigh and hops down from her perch on the wall.\n  "I'm Rayne, although those who I hunt often refer to me as Bloodrayne. And, you've one less blood sucker plaguing your lands. Unfortunately, the trail died with him. Leaving me without a target to pursue. I don't suppose you've any useful leads?"\n  I shrug and share that I wasn't even aware of the one that she had apparently finished off. I watch as her gaze takes in the magnificence of the moon. I inquire as to her plans, since her trail has gone cold in the hunt for more prey. She shrugs and says that she'll find somewhere to blend in, and then she'll listen, as rumors often bare results of one form or another when properly pursued.\n  Interesting, she's looking for somewhere to stay for a bit...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5503.1;She looks at her blades, as if just noticing that she has them out. With a shrug, she responds.\n  "There was a vampire hunting in these lands. It hunts not more. I'm Rayne by the way, although those who I hunt often refer to me as Bloodrayne. Unfortunately, the trail died with him. Leaving me without a target to pursue. I don't suppose you've any useful leads?"\n  I shrug and share that I wasn't even aware of the vampire that she had apparently finished off, and I thank her on the behalf of those who will now be spared from its hunger. I watch as her gaze takes in the magnificence of the moon. I inquire as to her plans, since her trail has gone cold in the hunt for more prey. She shrugs and says that she'll find somewhere to blend in, and then she'll listen, as rumors often bare results of one form or another when properly pursued.\n  Interesting, she's looking for somewhere to stay for a bit...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5503.2;I make it clear that I'm no thrall. She seems to look into me for a bit before letting out a sigh and hopping down from her perch on the wall.\n  "I'm Rayne, although those who I hunt often refer to me as Bloodrayne. While I can smell a bloodsucker a mile away, thrall's aren't as easy as it's more about judging their mannerisms. You seem to be in charge of your mental faculties, and you're not panicking after I identified myself, so I'll assume you're no vampire's thrall. Anyway, you've one less blood sucker plaguing your lands. Unfortunately, the trail died with him. Leaving me without a target to pursue. I don't suppose you've any useful leads?"\n  I shrug and share that I wasn't even aware of the one that she had apparently finished off. I watch as her gaze takes in the magnificence of the moon. I inquire as to her plans, since her trail has gone cold in the hunt for more prey. She shrugs and says that she'll find somewhere to blend in, and then she'll listen, as rumors often bare results of one form or another when properly pursued.\n  Interesting, she's looking for somewhere to stay for a bit...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5503A;Invite Rayne to my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight5503B;Wish Rayne luck (do no invite to court);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight3000;It has been a couple of weeks since I awoke a changed person. I've been finding out that many of the rumors regarding vampires aren't true.\n  I'm able to dine on food, although my tastes do indeed lean towards meat that is rawer than previously. I even consumed garlic earlier in the week, and while I didn't die, it did indeed give me diarrhea something awful. I'm able to stand in the sun, although I must say it is quite uncomfortable and a painful headache develops over time. I also crossed a stream that had running water without complications. I've also arranged for a variety of holy symbols to be brought before me, a desire to familiarize myself with other cultures I told my [Root.GetMyChancellorName]. And while some of them made me uncomfortable, none caused me to burst into flames or run hiding in a corner.\n  So outside of some severe discomfort, many of the weaknesses of vampires appear to be misrepresented. Which leaves me wondering what weaknesses are there that I don't know about.\n  I'm contemplating such considerations during dinner, when my [Root.GetMyChancellorName] informs me that there is a noble gentleman who wishes to meet with me tomorrow night. It almost sounds as though the word night was stressed. Intrigued, I make it known I shall accept the meeting offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight3000A;Perhaps answers are coming to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight3010;It's about an hour after dusk, when the mysterious noble gentleman arrives at my court. He's dignified and well dressed, with a clear air of nobility about him that certainly goes a long way towards people somehow supressing the urge to vocalize shock at just how disgustingly ugly he is. He stops before me, and with a perfect bow, he presents himself to me.\n  "Good evening. I am Count [dw_noble_vampire.GetFullName]. I thank you for your time in seeing me, and wish to speak with you regarding some matters in private."\n  I see those still present in my court, shift a little uncomfortably that such a request was made. But I've questions, and I can sense that this man is a vampire as well. God I hope I don't grow to look like that.\n  I accept his request and direct some wine to be taken to my study where I'll meet with my guest. It's not long before we've both settled into opposite chairs, his ettiquette top notch the entire time.\n  Our conversation is informative. [dw_noble_vampire.GetFirstName] isn't the vampire that turned me. This is good, as if he was my sire, his taint on my blood would force a degree of loyalty. My observations about rumored weaknesses was close to correct, with the warning about those with strong spiritual conviction, as they can power something from uncomfortable to being dangerous, such as the brandishing of a holy symbol to drive me away.\n  I also learn that [dw_noble_vampire.GetFirstName] is without a home, and part of his wanting to meet with me was to request sanctuary within my domain. He pledes to share his knowledge further, if allowed to stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight3010A;Welcome to my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight3010B;I believe it best if you move on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight3020;I enter my study after a day holding court, to find [dw_noble_vampire.GetFirstName] softly stroking the hair of a woman.\n  "Have I ever told you about thralls? If not, it's best to think of them as human cattle. Those who are weak minded, can be dominated to become our willing subjects. They've multiple benefits, one of which is they don't resist our feeding upon them. No struggle or objections, means we a lower chance of being outed for what we are."\n  I watch as he grips her in preparation of feeding. Her eyes go wide, and her body yields control, much like a kitten when lifted by the scruff of its neck. He sinks his fangs into her neck, and feeds. When he finishes, he wipes his bloodied lips with a handkerchief.\n  "It's also very important that you feed. If you do not, you'll find your body weakening little by little every year, until you succumb to sickness or disease. Of course, feeding on our thralls does take a small toll on them, so they themselves will expire at some point, yet if careful with feeding, a thrall can last a decade or more. It should also be noted, that when a thrall is dominated, such domination is not tied solely to you. Any vampire who recognizes a thrall, would be able to utilize them, and the thrall will be compliant. That said, would you like to have a bite yourself?"\n  [dw_noble_vampire.GetFirstName] steps back form the woman and motions for me to take her. I can smell her blood, and I feel my own pulse quicken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight3020A;I accept the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight3020B;I refuse the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4800.0;I'm outside enjoying the cool evening air when I suddenly feel that I'm no longer alone. I turn, scanning the area for the interloper and find an enchanting woman, scantily clad in the cool evening air. Her eyes are piercing, and I can feel that she sees me for what I truly am.\n  "You are [Root.GetFullName]? I wouldn't have imagined your having the mark of a vampire upon you. I am Vampirella, kindred in our marks. I've come in search of you this evening, for I've a request with you being the ruler of these lands."\n  I learn several things from Vampirella. Her desire to meet with me was to seek a temporary domicile while she searches my lands for an artifact that she has been hunting for quite some years. She isn't certain that it is still here, however, her strongest lead led her here. The artifact itself is called a Blood Stone. A gem of some kind apparently. She wouldn't elaborate much on it other than it being something of a lost family relic. She's also very self confident, caring little for how others view her attire.\n  Her demeanor is pleasant, although I sense that she seeks an answer from me as to whether I'll accept her remaining here for a period of time. Providing an answer isn't easy though, as I can tell that there is something else about her. Something powerful, and I don't know if it's a danger to me or not.  I finally get a feel for part of it. I believe she may be an ancient vampire.\n  If that would pose a problem or not, I'm uncertain, although she is not aggressive towards me. I suppose I need to at least provide her an answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4800.1;I'm outside enjoying the cool evening air when I suddenly feel that I'm no longer alone. I turn, scanning the area for the interloper and find an enchanting woman, scantily clad in the cool evening air. Her eyes are piercing as though she's looking through me, yet I find her gaze somehow familiar.\n  "You are [Root.GetFullName]? I wouldn't have imagined your having the mark of Lilith upon you. I am Vampirella, a kin of yours as we both acknowledge Lilith as Mother. I've come in search of you this evening. I've a request with you being the ruler of these lands."\n  I learn several things from Vampirella. Her desire to meet with me was to seek a temporary domicile while she searches my lands for an artifact that she has been hunting for quite some years. She isn't certain that it is still here, however, her strongest lead led her here. The artifact itself is called a Blood Stone. A gem of some kind apparently.

Providing an answer isn't easy, as I can tell that there is something else about her. While she named Lilith as mother and she does have an enthralling beauty about her, I don't believe she's a Succubus herself. She's something powerful, and I don't know if it's a danger to me or not.  She seems to sense my unease and answers my fears directly. Vampirella is a vampire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4800.2;I'm outside enjoying the cool evening air when I suddenly feel that I'm no longer alone. I turn, scanning the area for the interloper and find an enchanting woman, scantily clad in the cool evening air. Her eyes are piercing, and I feel as though she is looking through me and taking measure of who I am.\n  "You are [Root.GetFullName]? I am Vampirella, an adventurer. I've come in search of you this evening, for I've a request with you being the ruler of these lands."\n  I learn several things from Vampirella. Her desire to meet with me was to seek a temporary domicile while she searches my lands for an artifact that she has been hunting for quite some years. She isn't certain that it is still here, however, her strongest lead led her here. The artifact itself is called a Blood Stone. A gem of some kind apparently.

She's also very self confident, caring little for how others view her attire.\n  Her demeanor is pleasant, although I sense that she seeks an answer from me as to whether I'll accept her remaining here for a period of time. I get the feeling there is clearly more to her, and I'm not certain if her presence will be a boon or a bane. I suppose I need to at least provide her an answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4800A;Please stay while you search.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4800B;I must ask that you move on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4500.0;While it is indeed safest to feed upon a thrall or a willing loved one, I must admit that it doesn't always sate my thirst. I could pull more from them, yet doing so would put their life at risk and create other potential issues.\n  I could always hunt though. Striking out into the night in search of a victim that may sate my thirst. Regardless of how I may carry myself normally, there are times that it is difficult to not look at others as little more than cattle.\n  If I do this, I need to expect that my target will be unwilling. As such, this could carry some risk. Of course, to fully drain an individual will give me considerably more energy than a normal feeding.\n  Is the risk, worth the potential reward?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4500A;Tonight I shall hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4500D;I think I shall pass on hunting tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4530.0;I move through the shadows, allowing my senses to guide me. I'm in no rush, so I can be picky with what I choose to induldge myself with.\n  I observe a merchant closing his shop for the evening. He's rather rotund, making him full of blood. His cough gives me pause. I slip closer and catch the scent of illness. With disgust, I move on.\n  I soon come across a pair of drunks. They're so wasted, they're barely holding each other up as they stumble along the dirt road back to their home. I consider it, as the chance for struggle would be minor, yet I decide against it in the end. Blood holds alchohol, and I've no desire to become inebriated this evening.\n  Just when I begin to consider more risky endeavors, I catch the scent of a young maiden nearby. I follow it and find a young lady, fast asleep. I climb up onto the window sill and take in the site before me. Young, healthy, and fast asleep.\n  Easier prey would be difficult to find. So the only question is whether I feed, or I instead retire for the evening?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4530A;I shall consume her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4530B;No, I shall not feed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight3030;Having trouble sleeping, I find myself wandering the halls late at night. I notice the scent of blood on the air, with a odd slurping sound.\n  Following my senses, I find [dw_noble_vampire.GetFirstName] seated at the dining hall table, consuming blood as though one would a bowl of soup. He looks at me, takes another slurp of his blood soup, and then proceeds to wipe away the blood dripping from his chin.\n  "I assure you, it's not one of your staff. Alas, your streets are short one more would-be mugger who choose his target poorly. He was healthy though, so it seemed wrong to let it all go to waste. Feeding in the streets seemed inappropriate, so I collected a bit and sought to mix it with some porridge from your kitchen. I hope you don't mind."\n  I assure him that I've no objections and take a seat at the table. I politely decline his offer of some of the bloody porridge and inquire as to what's new.\n  "Ah, I've heard word that a book called Diablerie may not be a mere legend. It's been decades since I last heard rumor of it. Most vampires scoff and view it as simple fable, while others seek it for the rumored power it holds."\n  I've not heard of the book before, so I ask several questions. [dw_noble_vampire.GetFirstName] says that depending on the rumors you prefer, the book either contains the secret to obtaining immortality for a vampire, or that it is truly a curse that spells doom for vampires foolish enough to possess it. He admits to believing that the book more likely holds doom than greater power. Regardless, he finds it intriguing because it's an unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight3030A;I am very interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight3030B;I don't seek more power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4600.0;I sit before the mysterious tome of Diablerie. It is an ancient book, written in a language or code that is presently foreign to me. I'm going to have to do some translations and judging from the size of the book, I'm easily looking at something that may take years to fully comprehend.\n  The more I look through the book, the more I'm certain that it contains secrets which will make me more powerful. I prepare a writing instrument for the notes that I shall be making as I ready to dive in.\n  The only question left now is just how studious I shall be. Shall I sacrifice sleep in the interest of progress, or do I avoid increasing the stress of an already daunting task through studying in moderation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4600.1;The book has proven to be a fountain of knowledge so far. Covering the little things that are easily overlooked and pointing out ways to better blend into society.\n  What I've translated just recently indicates a different arch. One of self discovery, where I'm to come to understand the power of the blood within me. It entails fasting. No food, drink or blood for six months. With each evening being devoted to meditation, where I look inward to listen to my own blood. The author is clear on the risks, with insanity a definite possibility for one without the will and focus to see the process through.\n  The thought of fasting for such an extended period, with no relief, doesn't sound desirable. Alas, the code used within the rest of the tome has changed. So far, it almost seems like each section is a key for understanding and unlocking the next. If I do not pursue the fasting, I may not be able to continue any further.\n  I close my eyes and ponder the challenge. The book has shown to have knowledge, but is there truly additional power to obtain? I open my eyes and staring at the book, I make my decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4600.4;I've finished the book.\n This localization was incomplete and I'm just putting this hear so I can compile it without an error for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4600A;I shall push myself to learn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4600B;I shall take my time learning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4600C;I shall proceed with the fasting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNight4600D;I am done and shall study no longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
