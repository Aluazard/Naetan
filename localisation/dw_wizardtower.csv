dw_wizardtower01;I enter the Wizard Tower where I find it's ever vigilant keeper waiting for me.\n  "Good day [ROOT.GetTitledFirstName], the crow spoke of your approach. What may I assist you with this day?"\n\n If my learning is high enough, then I can seek training to become a mage myself, or to unlock a casting specialization.\n  If I've some coin available, I can take a look at their various wares they offer.\n  Another option with some coin is to obtain an arcane practitioner for my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower01a;I'm here to learn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower01b;I'm here to shop;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower01c;I'm here to recruit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower01d;Nevermind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower100;I make my way to the second level of the tower, where I meet the wizard that is responsible for arranging the recruitment of trained magic users. Most such arrangements are temporary, job specific contracts. However, as the ruler of these lands, I've the opportunity for a long term recruitment where I can add the individual to my court.\n  The mage responsible pours over his parchments to see who's ready for recruiting. After several minutes, he shares what's available for me to make my choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower100a;Random recruit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower100b;Recruit Scarlet Witch;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower100c;Recruit Raven;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower100d;Recruit Hermione;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower100e;Recruit Sorcey;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower100end;Nevermind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower101;I select the Scarlet Witch. I follow the recruiter to where she is presently training.\n  She's clearly surrounded with an impressive aura, as she's going through a series of complex hand motions. Noticing us, she gives a chant and alters her movements, causing the power she built up to slowly recede.\n  She looks from the recruiter to me. "It is a pleasure to meet the ruler of these lands. I'm Wanda Maximoff, although most around here refer to me as the Scarlet Witch."\n  We have a very interesting chat. I get the impression that her morale compass is a little fluid. I definitely get the impression that it'd be better to be on her good side than her bad side. Alas, she seems to have no issues with me during our discussion, and she indicates that she'll follow my lead and seek to be a reliable contributor to my goals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower101a;Welcome to my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower101b;Go experience the world (Banish);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower101c;Begone forever (Vanishes);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower102;I select the one called Raven. I follow the recruiter to a dark room, heavy in shadows save for light that spills in from an open window. There is a flash of light, followed by billowing smoke which roils about the room. At the edge of smoke and light, I see a dark clad figure. For just a moment, it seemed as though the smoke took the shape of wings, which disperses as the person notices us.\n  Approaching us, I see that the dark clothed figure is a young woman. She looks between the recruiter and I, and then gives a nod of acknowledgement.\n  "I am called Raven. If you wish my birth name, it is Rachel Roth. I assume I am now in your employ."\n  She's short on words, clearly not one fond of speaking. Still, her quiet bearing doesn't seem to be due to shyness, as she seems confident in herself based on her posture. Perhaps she's simply more humble than shy.\n  She begins tapping her foot, so patience isn't a strength of hers. Then again, I've not yet responded to her, so I guess I should stop with my silent assessment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower102a;Welcome to my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower102b;Go experience the world (Banish);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower102c;Begone forever (Vanishes);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower103;I select the one called Hermione, who I understand is a young mage who just completed her schooling. \n  I follow the directions up a spiraling staircase to a room with a young woman in the middle of it. She's starring intently at a book, silently mouthing something as though to get it's pronunciation correct. With the resolve apparent in her eyes, she quickly utters a string of arcane words and then with a flourish of her wrist and the wave of a wand, the smoke in the room forms the image of a cat that bounds around briefly before dissipating.\n  A smile beams on her face, until she finally notices me. It quickly disappears as she puts on a more serious and disciplined personae.\n  "Greetings [ROOT.GetTitledName]. Is there something I can assist you with?"\n  While she seeks to subdue it, I can almost see the excitement within her, clearly hoping my visit involves her and not simply directions to find another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower103a;Welcome to my court Hermione.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower103b;Go experience the world (Banish);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower103c;Begone forever (Vanishes);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower104;Having chosen to recruit the mage known as Sorcey, I follow the directions up a spiraling staircase to a room with a woman seated on a large chair. She seems to be holding a one-sided conversation with a skull she is holding, when she stops and looks in my direction.\n  "Why hello [ROOT.GetTitledFirstName]. I'm Sorcey, and assuming you're looking for me, then just say the world and I'm more than ready to join your court."\n  I ask her why she would assume I'm there to invite her to court, and with a little pout, she mentions that no one seems to ask her for anything. Not even directions, so if I'm here, surely it's to recruit her.\n  Of course, that was my original intention as I walked up the stairway to come to this room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower104a;Welcome to my court Sorcey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower200.0;I make my way through the tower until I come across a small room that is filled with books, scrolls, and an assortment of objects that seem to range from the mundane to arcane. In the middle of the room is an elderly dwarven woman, with a winged serpent perched upon her shoulder. Upon noticing me, she gives me a grin and taps her staff cane excitedly on the ground.\n  "By the grace of Hermes, I never expected to see [ROOT.GetTitledFirstName] enter my humble classroom. I'm Drudga. What can I do for you?"\n  I explain that I'm interested in learning how to wield the mysterious magical energies that exist within this world. With this, the elderly dwarf looks me over with earnest. Clearly evaluating me.\n  "Very well, I can show you the basics. It's not quick. Most take about a year, some sooner, others longer. Once done, you'd be a mage. Be aware, it's only the beginning. There are specializations that you'd then likely want to follow-up on. In order to learn different spells.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower200.1;I make my way through the tower, back to the small room of my first instructor, Drudga. Upon entering, I find her there, looking the same as always.\n  "Welcome [ROOT.GetTitledFirstName], I am honored to see you here today as a fellow arcane user. Is there a new path of knowledge that I can point you towards?"\n  Transmutation Specialists use magic that remakes an object. Evocation Specialists manipulate energy with explosive results and are commonly employed as Battle Mages. Necromancers specialize in magic related to the dead. Summoner Specialists use complex rituals to call forth beings from elsewhere.\n  Training time for each is similar to the time investment of mage training that you've completed (roughly a year).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower200a;I'm ready to start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower200b;Transmutation Training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower200c;Evocation Training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower200d;Necromancy Training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower200e;Summoning Training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower200end;I've nothing left to learn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower201;My elderly dwarven instructor calls out what largely seems like random titles out into the air. I hear some shuffling from behind the shelves and soon a young woman appears with a stack of books and scrolls.\n  "Here dearie, please give the items to [ROOT.GetTitledFirstName]."\n  I accept the materials and the young woman gives a small curtesy before excusing herself.\n  "A good young lass she is. A fair amount of potential herself. Like you, she's in training, yet without a place to call home, she stays here. You meanwhile, are of course free to do your reading and training where you please. Difference in status and all. Just remember, most take about a year, others less, others more. Stay your course, and you'll be a mage in the end."\n  I listen as she goes over the order of material, and a variety of other advice. Then with little more to add, she finally nods and let's me know that she's no more to share today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower201a;Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower202;I've made it through much of the introductory theories of magic, and am now ready for the next stage where I shall begin to learn how to control the arcane energies within the world. Based on what my arcane instructor has shared with me, I've just completed the first third of the journey. The next third is a risky one, where those who've pressed to quickly have suffered mishaps.\n  Do I push myself to bring a quicker resolution to my training, or shall I stay the course?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower202a;I shall stay the course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower202b;I shall push myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower202c;What's the hurry?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower203;I have advanced my understanding of the arcane to the stage where I can focus the energies within my hands. When I focus enough, I can even see the energies taking shape, akin to a ball of wispy energy.\n  The next stage in my training is the last third. At it's completion I will be a mage with a foundation in controlling magical energies that can be formed into spells. This next stage is more risky than the last one to try and speed through, yet the allure of achieving my end goal sooner rather than later is awfully appealing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower204;I've made it. After having displayed my knowledge and control in front of Drudga and several other mages of the Wizard's Tower, I've been declared a mage myself.\n  I can now shape the arcane energies around me and cast spells.\n\n  NOTE: In an attempt to simplify things, I'm just going to use spell cooldowns instead of having a mana or other value to track. The more powerful the spell, the longer its cooldown. There is a potion the Wizards Tower sells on occasion, a Mana Potion, that when consumed will remove any cooldown effects that are in place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower204a;I am now a mage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower210;I follow Drudga's directions and come to a small room where an elderly dwarf is observing a raven haired woman who is standing within a cauldron covered with arcane symbols. The dwarven man notices me and then turns his attention back towards the woman.\n  "Welcome Magus [ROOT.GetFirstName]. My potions are sold in the shop, unless you're hear for another reason. If that's the case, how may I, Brindleburg, be of assistance?."\n  I state my desire to be trained further in transmutation magic. Brindleburg pauses for a moment. Then he taps his head with a flask he's holding and pours some of its contents into the cauldron. After staring intently at the smoke that rises, he turns and makes some notes in a tome.\n  "One who specializes in transmutations must be ready for a lot of lab work. I'll not teach you how to make potions, yet instead how to understand the magic we use as part of the process. Of course, you'll learn new spells. Still interested?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower210a;I'm ready to start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower211;I've reached the first milestone of my training according to my Transmutation instructor Brindleburg. These months have been filled with learning just as much about the mundane world, as it has been about magic. I understand now that in order to better transmute something, that the greater the knowledge of something, the easier it is to change it with magic.\n  The next stage of my training will involve experimentation. I could always push things, but of course that carries risks, while staying the course is definitely the safer path to take.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower212;My Transmutation Instructor, Brindleburg, has informed me that he feels I've reached the second milestone of my training. After months of experimentation where I saw things go both better than expected and worse than I had imagined, I'm finally ready for the next stage. This final stage is the last leg of the journey in becoming a Transmutation Specialist.\n  I'll be learning how to formulate and cast proper transmutation spells. The end of the road is almost in sight. Do I push the boundaries recommended by my instructor, or do I stay the course?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower213;I've achieved my goal. Having completed the third stage, I stood before and was evaluated by my Transmutation Instructor, Brindleburg. A man who is usually observing and commenting on areas of improvement, he's always been short on any kind of praise. Yet with my work done, he flashes the first smile I've seen from him.\n  "It's been a journey, and at times I admit I wondered if you endure it, yet here you are. Well done. I don't like to apply ranks to people, yet I feel it only fair to say that you've ended up being one of my more memorable students. May your education never end and secrets unfold before you.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower213a;I'm a Transmutation Specialist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower220;I follow Drudga's directions, and finally find myself in a chamber where an elven woman is standing in the middle of the room, with three balls of fire slowly rotating about her. She notices me and with a soft smile and a wave of her hand, the firey globes dissipate one after another.\n  "Ah, you're one of our fellow mages, [ROOT.GetFirstName]. Are you here for a visit? No? Oh, do you seek training? I do so enjoy training others in the joys of evocation."\n  I confirm that yes, I'm indeed here to receive training. The woman then introduces herself as Aelwyn. She then explains that what I walked in on is very much what I'll be doing the first part of my training. Which is to sense and focus on gathering different types of energy. It's a bit more meditative than other paths, with less tome studying until the later stages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower221;I've achieved the first milestone in my training Evocation magic with Aelwyn. She has expressed satisfaction at my ability to meditate and pull the various magical energy that exists around me, into condensed forms which can then be tuned towards specific elements.\n  It was after performing such an excercise and shaping the energy into spheres of intense heat and chilling cold, that she declared my knowledge sufficient to advance to the next stage.\n  The next stage involves projecting such energies, similar to the ability to project arcane energy that I learned as a mage, yet this time infused with an elemental component.\n  She does warn me about trying to push myself too quickly. More than one student has set themselves on fire, a most unpleasant experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower222;I've reached the second milestone. Aelwyn observed my control in being able to call forth elemental based arcane energy and project it with stunning results. The exercise left me fatigued and with the hint of a headache, yet Aelwyn's excitement at what I accomplished managed to still bring a smile to my face.\n  This past stage will help me greatly in self defense (GAME NOTE: To be reflected in the Combat Rating buff given by the Evocation Specialist modifier given at the end of training), the next stage will have me learning some of the most dangerous spells known. Pushing ahead of schedule can be life threatening if I make a mistake. I should choose how I progress with some careful consideration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower223;I've successfully completed my Evocation Specialist training. It was an exhilarating experience with fire, frost, and lightning galore. I can see why people fear mages, just based on the sheer destructive capability we can wield.\n  Aelwyn also showed a side of her I never really noticed. She seemed like a very level headed elven woman, yet ask I called forth spell after spell, there was a glint in her eyes that made me wonder how close she was to being lost to the feeling of power that come with wielding such forces. If anything, I made the mental note to stay on her good side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower223a;I'm an Evocation Specialist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower224;I've made a grave mistake. I was working on sensing and focusing the energy around me as I wandered to the market today. The sun was shining bright and I could almost feel it's rays of light aiding my training.\n  Then, before I knew it, flames were rippling out from my body. My concentration broke, and the flames rolled away from my like a wave, striking nearby buildings.\n  Luck was not with me at that moment, as the buildings caught fire. Efforts quickly mobilized, yet a building was lost, and I can only attribute it to my being aggressive with my training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower224a;I must be more careful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower225;I've made a grave mistake. I was working on sensing and focusing the energy around me as I wandered to the market today. The sun was shining bright and I could almost feel it's rays of light aiding my training.\n  Then, before I knew it, flames were rippling out from my body. My concentration broke, and the flames rolled away from my like a wave, striking nearby buildings.\n  Luck was not with me at that moment, as the buildings caught fire. Efforts quickly mobilized, yet a building was lost, and I can only attribute it to my being aggressive with my training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower225a;I must be more careful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower230;I follow Drudga's directions, which lead me to subterranean levels of the Wizard Tower. There, in an area that is cool, with the smell of death and preserves in the air, I find my objective. A man, his skin as pale as death, who is cloaked in attire of leathers and bone stands before me.\n  "I am Threzenoth. I've been expecting you [ROOT.GetTitledFirstName]. I understand you're now a fellow mage, and as one, I imagined it'd only be a matter of time before interest in my arts called out for you to seek for me."\n  Not exactly what I was expecting. Shrugging off his arrogant prophetic statement, I confirm that I'm indeed interested in learning Necromancy.\n  "Very good. These coming months shall expose you to many things. Your knowledge of the dead shall reach new heights."\n  I spend the rest of today listening to my new instructor speak highly of himself and how he'll make me great. At the end, I finally receive my first material to study, and I begin my journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower231;I've reached the first milestone in my necromancy training. Threzenoth has had me dissect and work with a variety of beast corpses, as they're usually less willful than the corpses of more intelligent beings. It has been very eye opening. How some vessels are nothing more than decaying flesh and bone, while others leave behind remnants of spiritual energy that can be interacted with.\n If there is a downside to my training so far, it's been several folks asking if I'm okay, for my skin has already begun to pale. While I thought Threzenoth simply didn't see the light of day, perhaps the effect on one's skin has more to do with the energies that we interface with.\n  As it is, the next stage of training will involve working with more advanced corpses. Those of humans and other intelligent species. Threzenoth never mentioned the risks of pushing forward too quickly, but it's safe to assume that there are risks by hurrying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower232;I've passed my second milestone. Threzenoth may be arrogant and short with the information he provides, but the key is not getting hung up on such trivial things. He expects his students to be intelligent and to find the answers among the hints he provides.\n  I'm now able to sense and pull residual energy left behind from the dead of humans and other intelligent species. Even a corpse that is decades old can harbor a hint of its former spirit.\n  The final stage that I am starting, shall be using these energies to formulate spells. Spells that are not viewed favorably by the inhabitants of the world. Regardless, I didn't choose to follow this path for the purpose of popularity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower233;My work is complete. I've stood before Threzenoth in a graveyard and called forth the bodies of the dead to heed my call. With this display of necromancy control, Threzenoth declared that I have completed my training.\n  I can see how one could adopt an air of arrogance, as the ability to call forth and work as the puppeteer over such soulless constructs gives one an amazing feeling of power. As though death itself would bend to our will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower233a;I'm a Necromancy Specialist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower240;I follow Drudga's instructions and ascend within the tower until I come to a chamber that is filled with a variety of arcane symbols. In the center of the room, sits, or rather floats a man in the center of a circle that is awash with arcane energy. I wait patiently and after a bit, the man opens his eyes and addresses me.\n  "Ah, welcome [ROOT.GetTitledFirstName], my mage brother. What may I, Shaleesh, do for you this blessed day?"\n  I explain my desire to learn more about summoning, and that I understand it is his specialty as an instructor. He grins and steps forward, taking my hand in a firm grasp.\n  "I, Shaleesh, welcome the opportunity to train you."\n  He then pulls out some tomes and hands them to me, along with some vials. He says that the first part of my training is learning the symbolism involved in safely summoning beings. I nod in understanding and leave with my materials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower241;I've reached my first milestone in becoming a Summoning Specialist. I've learned such a variety of symbols and various means for making them, along with what ingredients to use in candles, inks, or the like. All of which depends on the type of symbol being used.\n  My first stage came to its completion in Shaleesh's eyes when I was able to craft a symbol, and then infuse it with a magical aura from special candles I had also crafted.\n  The next stage of the training is one of the more dangerous according to Shaleesh, as it will involve learning how to communicate through such symbols. Much like he was when I met him, one can apparently use symbols to speak to other beings from beyond. Many of which would seek to do me harm.\n  So the dangers are clear, as I decide if I shall stay the course or risk pushing ahead faster. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower242;I've reached my second milestone under Shaleesh's tutelage. I have successfully protected myself and communed with beings from beyond. As part of a test, Shaleesh left a message for me to locate with a denizen of the underworld. It was quite the challenge, as the one holding his message wasn't willing to give it freely, yet I managed to obtain it without giving anything of worth.\n  Shaleesh was pleased, and said that it was time for the final stage, where I shall learn various spells. And while I've shown the ability to communicate and not fall prey to other worldly beings, I shouldn't take them for granted, as they will seek to strike if I lessen my guard. This next stage is even more dangerous, as it could involve physical manifestations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower243;I've completed my training in Summoning. With Shaleesh observing, I went through the steps of crafting a circle, empowering it, and then communicating with a creature from beyond our realm before calling them forth into it.\n  I choose a Succubus at Shaleesh's recommendation, as it provides a fair challenge in terms of control. Largely because of it's unnatural ability to entice and lure beings to it. It seemed more than a little disappointed when Shaleesh signaled that we were done and I dismissed it back to its realm.\n  "You've done quite well [ROOT.GetTitledFirstName]. I've nothing else I teach you. Congratulations in achieving something that many do not.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower243a;I'm a Summoning Specialist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower244;I've made a foolish mistake. In striving to push forward, an oversight had me not communing with one being from beyond, but several. Worse, they're demons, the kind that specialize in chipping away at one's mind until they can establish a foothold.\n  I quickly fell back on my training and sought to no longer interact with them, but to instead bolster my own resolve. Still regardless of my focus, they where there. Chipping away slowly at my resolve.\n  When I was uncertain how much longer I could hold out, I was saved. Shaleesh came to check on my progress and found my state. After sealing the off their voices, he helped coax me back to a proper mind set.\n  Seeing I was safe at last, he admonished my reckless action and warned that lunacy or worse could have befallen me.\n  Not wishing a repeat, I took a much more cautious approach for the rest of this stage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower244a;I shall be more careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower245;I've made a foolish mistake. In striving to push forward, an oversight had me not communing with one being from beyond, but several. Worse, they're demons, the kind that specialize in chipping away at one's mind until they can establish a foothold.\n  I quickly fell back on my training and sought to no longer interact with them, but to instead bolster my own resolve. Still regardless of my focus, they where there. Chipping away slowly at my resolve.\n  This lasted through the night, until the candles burned out, and the link severed. I can still hear the whispers in my head, but I made it through. I'm certain that I'm alright.\n  Aren't I?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower245a;I shall be more careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower300;I make my way to the small shop within the Wizard's Tower. The room is packed with a variety of items. Various ingredients, potions, ointments, books and scrolls make up the bulk of it, with a smaller assortment of clothing, weapons, and accessories.\n  The shop keeper looks up from her book, looks me over as if measuring whether I belong there, and then she waves her hand towards the room.\n  "Feel free to look about, unless there is something specific that you wish to purchase [ROOT.GetTitledFirstName]."\n  They always have a selection of potions and ingredients available, although the ingredients are most suited for members of the Hermetic society. They've a decent selection of tomes and scrolls, with an occasional rarity appearing. That leaves the small assortment of clothing, weapons, and accessories, where it is extremely rare to find a truly remarkable item. They do usually have a couple basic items though, items of note that might make a good start to one's treasury collection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dw_wizardtower300home;Return to tower entry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower301;I opt to look over the potions and ingredients.\n  They've quite a selection, although many of their items aren't special. Things that have little actual benefit, yet are carried due to popular beliefs among the citizenry that may slip in seeking something for curiosity.\n  The objects available also change over time, while some are clearly more common and therefore more likely to be in stock.\n  Of course, buying ingredients is really only beneficial if one is a member of the Hermetic society. Potions or other items though can be used by just about anyone.\n\n  Choose the category you wish to view. Transmutation Potions are for those who are seeking to modify their body in some fashion. Other Potions are those that don't change you body in some fashion and are clearly lacking a cooler name. Hermetic Ingredients are, well, hermetic ingredient artifacts used by Hermetic Society members.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dw_wizardtower302;I decide to look over the volumes of books and stacks of scrolls. There are a variety of topics covered among the pages, and it's clear that not all titles are clear as to the contents held within.\n  After looking through some for a bit, I feel a hand on my shoulder. I turn and notice the shopkeeper. She smiles at me and reminds me that she runs a shop, and not a library. Something about her smile keeps me from being offended at her remark, and she soon offers to show me some items that she believes would be worth considering to add to my personal library.\n\n  Game Note: Hover over the options to see which artifact would be procured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dw_wizardtower302b;Scrolls;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower303;I decide to look over the limited selection of oddities. There are a variety of items. Some clothing, armors, cloaks, trinkets, weapons, and curiosities.\n  After looking them over, I feel that most of it is simply shop filler. Sure it's fine quality, but I can get similar items at market.\n  There are however, a trio of items that stand above the rest and could be worth adding to my treasury.\n\n  Game Note: Hover over the options to see which artifact would be procured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dw_wizardtower304;The majority of potions sold presently are transmutations. The others are cobbled together off to the side as 'Others'. This doesn't mean they're any less difficult to manufacture, or less powerful. While the available stock of transmutation potions changes regularly, these other potions tend to be more frequent in regards to what I can expect to find.\n\n  Game Effect: There are two options for potions. One take effect when selected. Others may allow the person buying it, to hold and gift the person to another person (via targeted decision).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dw_wizardtower310;This potion allows a female to grow some extra equipment.\n  A non-futa female can use it now, or it can be held and gifted to a woman for them to consider using.\n  A trusting, lustful, or prisoner target will use the potion, while a paranoid person (unless they're a prisoner) will not. It's a 50-50 chance outside of that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower310a;Use it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower310b;Hold onto it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower311;This potion will change a person's gender to be the opposite of what it is currently. Warning: messing with a character's gender may have unintended side effects so use with caution.\n  A trusting, homosexual, feminine, masculine, or prisoner target will use the potion, while a paranoid person (unless they're a prisoner) will not. It's a 50-50 chance outside of that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower312;This potion will increase a woman's breast size.\n  A trusting, envious, or prisoner target will use the potion, while a paranoid person (unless they're a prisoner) will not. It's a 50-50 chance outside of that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower313;This potion will increase a person's dick size.\n  A trusting, envious, or prisoner target will use the potion, while a paranoid person (unless they're a prisoner) will not. It's a 50-50 chance outside of that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower320;This potion is something that would infuriate the church should they know of its existence. This potion contains a specially cultured symbiote that is inert until consumed. Once consumed it will bond with its new host.\n  Why someone would want to do such an act differs from those who seek more power, to those who seek to bring others to ruin due to it being such a taboo act.\n  If you plan on giving the potion to another, a trusting, lunatic, or prisoner target will use the potion, while a paranoid person (unless they're a prisoner) will not. It's a 50-50 chance outside of that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower320a;Use it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower320b;Hold onto it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower321;This potion changes a person to make them more attractive. Going so far to remove some birth defects should they exist. If one is already at the peak of their beauty, it grants Aphrodite's Blessing, which shrouds the individual in an alluring aura for a year.\n  It is important to realize that this potion is ineffective against injury. So severe trauma that caused scarring or disfigurement will need a suitable healing potion to address those malformations. The potion also doesn't make one the peak of beauty immediately. If one is burdened by birth defects that affects their beauty, then one is corrected. Thus potentially requiring multiple administrations of the potion.\n  If gifted to someone else, only those who are paranoid are likely to refuse it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower322;This potion increases a person's height, up to that of a Giant (the trait). It increases in increments, so one with the stature of a dwarf would simply find themselves the height of your average person.\n  Opting to gift the potion to a person will find it being widely accepted and used by those of a tribal culture (80%), while most others are much less likely to accept it (20%).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower323;This potion is able to determine if your blood is not entirely human, awakening a blood/kin trait from your past. The potential outcome is determined by the culture group you belong too.\n  If you already have a hereditary trait of some type, then it is possible that you will not get any benefit from using this potion. Multiple uses of the potion carry the chance for multiple discoveries, yet each subsequent use carries a risk of no new result.\n  Be warned, many cultures include things such as giants or dwarves, so those traits can be unlocked as well.\n  If you are looking to gift this potion to someone, it is best received by mystics or trusting individuals, while others will give it a 50-50 chance unless they're paranoid. \n\n  NOTE: if you feel like I've a gross omission, let me know in the support thread for the mod.\n  NOTE 2: If you disable different race type options in the mod settings, then it may negate some results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower324;This potion carries a significant risk, as society in large does not tolerate Vampires. And with a potion of Elder Blood, using it will cause a person to become such a creature.\n  It is said that those who are already vampires, seek out such potions, as consuming them carry a small chance of obtaining immortality (20%).\n  Giving the potion to someone as a gift is a risky venture, as only those who are cruel or impalers seem to accept such a gift openly, while most others will opt to not use such a vile potion. (20%);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower330;This potion will reduce a person's age by 10 years. Regardless of brewed variations, it doesn't seem to work on anyone younger than 26.\n  If you plan on giving the potion to another, a trusting, envious, proud, attractive, or prisoner target will use the potion, while a paranoid person (unless they're a prisoner) will not. It's a 50-50 chance outside of that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower331;This potion is a minor health potion. It is limited in what it can heal, and if there is nothing to be healed, it'll fortify the person's health.\n  It only impacts one item, so if a person has multiple afflictions that could be addressed by this potion, they would need multiple potions to address them all.\n  It can heal a wound, reduce scarring, clear lover's pox, and remove some diseases and symptoms.\n  If you decide to share the potion with someone else, only those who are paranoid or zealous are likely to refuse such an offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower332;This potion is a major health potion. It can heal just about any would or disease.\n  In cases of extreme wounds - such as having lost a limb, the limb will be restored along with heavy scarring. If someone is suffering from multiple items, only one will be addressed, so multiple uses may be necessary.\n  If the person has no ill effects, then their health will be substantially fortified as a result.\n  It can heal a wound, reduce scarring, clear lover's pox, and remove some diseases and symptoms.\n  If you decide to share the potion with someone else, only those who are paranoid or zealous are likely to refuse such an offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower340;A dangerous brew that is said to break down the barriers that we erect as we mature, to allow us to see the world as it truly is for a brief moment. This increased awareness either results in personal growth from the insight, or it causes mental trauma.\n  The growth often results in individuals who improve in just about every facet of their being. While the trauma can cause lunacy or severe depression. There are even reports of those who fell so far into their depression, that they later committed suicide.\n  If you opt to gift this potion to someone, only those who are ambitious, envious, or greedy are likely to risk it without question. Four out of five others will pass entirely on the risk, with the paranoid, craven or content opting to not risk it at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower341;This potion inspires one with dreams and thoughts of engineering marvels. This allows the individual to direct the results of any construction within their demesne to achieve improved performance in meeting construction timeframes and costs. Allowing projects to be completed quicker and cheaper, which in turn makes more resources available for other endeavors.\n  The effects last about a year.\n\n  This potion CAN NOT be gifted to another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower342;The infamous love potion. If taken instead of gifted, it makes the drinker more alluring to others. If gifted to another, and that person drinks it, then they'll fall in love with each other.\n  Not everyone is willing to drink such a potion though. Those who are trusting, lustful, or poets will always consume it. Others are a little more skeptical to having such feelings without the process of courting, and as such are less likely to drink it (25%);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower343;This potion is only of use to those trained in the use of magic. When casting a spell, time must then pass for the body to recover the power necessary to allow it to be cast once again. A mana potion revitalizes the magical energy that was expended and allows spells to be cast once again.\n  This item can be gifted - even to yourself if you want to hold onto it for later.\n  If the short description wasn't obvious, taking this potion removes any spell cooldowns that are in place. These spell cooldowns are of course limited to only this mod. If you're using another magic based mod, this won't help whatever mechanism it uses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower399;It has come to my attention that the potion I provided [dw_potion_target.GetBestName], was poured out. I'm disappointed in their decision, yet it was clearly a risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower399a;Well hell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower1010;A pleasant surprise, I've been healed by [dw_healer.GetBestName]. With my wound gone, I can now continue on without it weighing on me any more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower1010a;Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower1020;The spell converts an amount of iron into gold, equal to 100 gold coins. This is the safe, or normal casting of the spell.\n  For the transmutation mage who is willing to infuse the spell with some of their life force, they can increase the results to produce the equivalent of 300 gold coins.\n  In the most dire situations a mage can even channel more of their life force into the spell, generating up to 500 gold coins.\n  The infusion methods have resulted in mages dying not long afterwards, and it can make them extremely vulnerable to diseases.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dw_wizardtower1031;I'm watching the clouds overhead gather into the signs of a pending storm. Not wishing to be caught out in the rain, I turn to head inside. At that moment, I feel the little hairs on the back of my neck stand, and then I'm suddenly blinded by a bright light.\n  There is an echoing BOOM that shakes me to my core, and I realize I'm on my knees, with my chest in agony with every breath I take seeming to flare a fire within me.\n  People are running towards me and I find it difficult to stand. It comes to me suddenly, I've, I've been struck by lightning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower1031a;Ouch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower1032;I've learned that [dw_spell_target.GetBestName] has been struck by a lightning today. Alas, [dw_spell_target.GetFirstName] seems to have managed to not perish outright, although I understand they're wounded from the strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower1032a;So close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower1033;There is a blinding flash as I feel my body failing. As my consciousness fades, a boom fills the air.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower1033a;The reaper takes me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower1034;Great news has come to me. I've learned that [dw_spell_target.GetBestName] has apparently fallen to a rare occurrence of Mother Nature. Word is that an errant lightning strike has taken their life. Oh the tragedy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower1034a;Success!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower1035;I'm watching the clouds overhead gather into the signs of a pending storm. Not wishing to be caught out in the rain, I turn to head inside.\n  Suddenly there is a bright flash, followed by a resounding BOOM that echoes through the area.\n  I look at the burned tree nearby and realize that I was little more than an arms length from a lightning strike. It was so close it left my hair standing on end, with a charred scent in hanging in the air. I'll need to be more careful on days like today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower1035a;I'm lucky to be alive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower1036;I've received word that [dw_spell_target.GetBestName] narrowly missed getting struck by lightning. I nodded in comprehension at the word, while seething inside that they had managed to some escape my strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower1036a;What pitiful news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower1040;Fzzt!\n  With a blast of pure destructive arcane energy, I disintegrate [dw_spell_target.GetBestName], reducing them to little more than dust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower1040a;Hahahahaha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower1050;One of the earliest spells that is known to have existed is one that binds an intelligent animal to the mage. These beings are known as familiars and are rarities among their kind as the creatures appear to have an affinity that when bound to a mage, brings the most out of their potential intellect. And as the creature benefits from the bond, so to does the mage, with the benefits varying with the creature they form a bond with.\n  I understand that the creature that responds to the summons isn't something that can be pre-determined, as the spell seeks the nearest, compatible creature to form the bond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower1050a;Come to me my pet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower1060;I've prepared the interlinked circles of power. I shall be in one, while using the other to call the imp that I shall bind to me. I position myself, light the candles and incense, and begin the chant.\n  I'm in a meditative trance, repeating the chant over an over, when I feel the imp finally cross over. I come out of my trance and begin the binding incantation.\n  The imp realizes it's position and attempts to flee, yet the circle holds. As I finish the first incantation, I feel my life link to the imp's. It goes rigid as I continue the incantations. Each one linking us together, although in the form of a puppeteer and his puppet.\n  When it is finally finished, I'm spent, as is the creature. Any attempt at harming me will rebound on it five times over, and imps are well known for their dislike of receiving pain.\n  It's black eyes are staring at me, measuring me. When it finally blinks, it's body language relaxes, as though it's decided to accept me and not fight any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower1060a;It is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower1070;I have prepared the circle and supporting materials to assist in my piercing the veil of this world, to commune with powers that are always observing. Some call these voices the Fates, or Demons, or even some believe them to be the voice of God. The guidance and insight provided results in benefits, alas, the benefits may not be what was sought.\n  The candles lit, I calm my breathing into a steady pattern and I focus on following the whispers in the beyond. Communing is rarely a quick process. It's more like a grand hunt. Following whispers in the void, seeking those that increase in volume.\n  I'm in luck, I've a solid lead. I push my mind forward, ignoring the denizens seeking to steer me away from that which I seek.\n  I finally trace my trail to the source. The voice doesn't acknowledge me. Instead, it's as if it's speaking to itself, or perhaps another that doesn't respond. I'm more like an eavesdropper. Gleaning knowledge meant for another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower1070a;I've obtained insight;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower1080;A pleasant surprise, I've been healed by [dw_spell_caster.GetBestName]. I can now continue on without it weighing on me any more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dw_wizardtower1100;Calling forth a horde of undead warriors is taxing.

dw_wizardtower5100;I let Sorcey know that I desire a Wizard's Consultation, and she gladly makes the time to sit down with me. I inquire as to what special services I can obtain from her, and she shares her capabilities. \n  Her primary supportive function is her restorative foods. She can address several ailments at a minimal energy cost. Her secondary ability is immensely draining, yet with enough energy, she can turn a target into a frog.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5100A;I'm interested in your restorative foods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5100B;Oh I know just who I'd like to turn into a frog.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5100D;On second thought, I've no present needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5101;Sorcey smiles and says, "I'm proud to say that my food offerings are some of the best support magic offerings around." \n  "While only able to handle your basic wounds and scarring, my basic healing food can't be beat for the low energy cost. While my fortitude building food can be the secret to a longer life if you so desire." \n  "I even offer a honeyed sauce that can bring out one's ability to better communicate.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5101A;I've need of your basic healing food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5101B;I'd like some of your fortitude building food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5101C;I've need of honeyed words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5101D;I'm going to pass for now. Thank you for your time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5102;I ask if she meant a toad and Sorcey chuckles. "Oh dear no. There is a reason why it's said that old hags can turn someone into a toad. The spell energies are largely shaped by the caster, and since my skin isn't dry and wart encrusted, a toad is simply out of the question. Now a smooth skinned frog, that's a better representation of me. And if you're insinuating otherwise, well, then I may have a different target for the spell than the one you intend for me to focus upon." \n  "I should also warn you, such a spell is a curse through and through, and as such it'll pull from you a great deal of energy. Ensure it's worth the cost for you to visit such wrath upon someone.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5102A;Prepare the spell, I've a target in mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5102B;The cost is too steep at the moment, so I must pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5251;It's late and I'm in the mood to roam, so I find myself wandering the halls of my estate. While walking through the basement area, I hear an odd moan, and being curious I follow it to find Hermione sitting in an arcane circle. \n  I can see by the lantern light that she is squirming, looking confused as if trying to figure out a problem. Her body's actions don't match the confusion on her face as she allows her blouse to fall off her shoulders and reveal a glimpse of her breast, while a hand traces softly along her leg. \n  "Hermione, are you alright?" \n  Her eyes seem to struggle to focus on me. "My body... The spell... I feel my inhibitions being stripped away. The circle... you must break it... or I won't be able to stop myself." \n  As if to accentuate the point, I watch as her hand traces up her thigh and a moan escapes her lips. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5251A;I break the boundary of the circle to free Hermione.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5251B;Intrigued, I let the spell complete changing Hermione.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5252.0;After breaking the circle that was tearing away at Hermione's mind, she collapsed and had to be carried to her bed. She slept soundly through the night and through most of the following day. \n  When I next saw her, she had an energy about her and her eyes looked deeply into mine. "I appreciate your saving me my [Root.GetLordLady]. I was foolish to experiment with such magic, without adequate means to handle a problem. I can only imagine what would have happened if you didn't save me. It could have cost me my magical abilities entirely." \n  After a few questions, I learn that she was trying to interpret an arcane tome that she had found. And apparently the magic is meant to strip away one's inhibitions, leaving them filled with lust. Hermione now feels she can do the opposite with her magic, the ability to remove lustful or hedonistic thoughts from a person should I wish it. In fact, she believes she can make a normal person become chaste, and a chaste one celibate. \n  I just need to point her towards the desired target, and if I have the energy (piety) necessary to draw upon, she'll make it happen. \n  "Please know that what you did for me has my gratitude, and should you wish it, I'd be honored to be your love. For you've shown to be one who respects and appreciates who I am.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dw_wizardtower5252C;I'm just thankful that you're well my love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5253.0;I watched Hermione squirm within the circle until she convulsed and screamed out as though experiencing an extreme climax. She then collapsed and laid motionless outside of some occasional twitching, so I had her carried to her chambers. \n  It was the evening of the next day when it dawned upon me that I had not heard from her, so I stopped by her room. I found a very unexpected site, as the young wizard was nearly naked upon her bed, knees up and her pussy clearly exposed. Although I stood there in the doorway, she paid me no attention as she focused arcane energies around her swollen mound. \n  "Unh, oh, oh, ah, can't... Can't get enough... Unh, oh..." \n  I watched as Hermione reached a climax that left her panting and near collapse, yet she began flicking her wrist once more to keep the energy swirling about her womanhood. I considered stepping into the room, yet my body seemed hesitant to enter the swirling mystical forces. \n  After watching a little longer, I don't see an end in sight, so I close the door to her room, to leave her alone with her struggle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dw_wizardtower5253A;I appear to have lost my wizard to her carnal desires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5253B;It appears my lover has become lost in her lust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5254.0;A week has gone by and the Wizard that I originally obtained, is no longer the one who wanders the halls of my estate now. The staff gives her a wide berth, as she's prone to speaking wildly to herself, and getting her to completely cover herself is a chore. \n  Her arcane abilities appear to be stunted, as her body is the only thing she explores with her magic theories. I've consulted the head Wizard at the tower, and he spoke what others suspected. She has been driven mad, and is often consumed by fits of lustful lunacy. Although she does have moments of lucidity, where she can function almost normally. \n  This evening, I find her wandering the halls once more, her clothing not hiding her precious parts. \n  "My [Root.GetLordLady], I've an itch, would you mind helping me scratch it? Just this evening. Plus, I won't bother you with the romantic necessities of a true relationship. I'm just in need of some flesh based stimulus." \n  She's been with several this week, and all of them swore it was a mistake as they say she can't be satisfied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

I've been unable to satisfy her so far, and I know it's only a matter of time before she lays with another, if it hasn't already happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5254A;Yes, I will help you scratch your itch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5254B;I think it'd be best to pass for tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5255;I agree to the offer and she wastes no time, grabbing me by the wrist and dragging me to the nearby bedroom as she tosses off her clothes and hops onto the bed. Looking over her shoulder she mutters something along the lines of 'Lubrioso'. I pause for a second, as I expect something to happen to me. The pause is too long as she moans, 'Noooo, come on. I'm ready for you. No need to be gentle, the spell lubed me.' \n  I drop my pants and pull out my cock, aiming it at her pussy. \n  "No, I need to feel it rougher. Fuck my ass. It's ready. Please, fuck my ass as hard as you want!" \n  I shrug as I line up and push against her asshole. It parts and I sink in smoothly. Her ass is tight, and I can feel it squeezing all around my cock. \n  "Fuck me. Fuck me hard!" \n  Seeing no reason not to oblige, I begin driving it home. Hermione grips the bedding and shoves her body backwards making it a very rough anal fucking. My head's spinning from the sensation, and I smack her ass cheek. She lets out a whimper that turns into a moan, so I give it several more good smacks until her ass is nice and red. \n  Finally, I've reached my peak, she seems to sense it as well as she begins screaming out as I stop moving. She's tossing her ass back on my cock violently all by herself and it sends me over, my cock twitching as I cum inside her ass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5255A;While Hermione peaked, she's still frustrated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5256;I agree to the offer and Hermione drags me to the nearest room where with a few flicks of her wand, leaves us both undressed. She licks her lips as she looks at me, as though a ravenous person preparing to dig into dinner. \n  "My breasts... 'Expansioso'" A moan escapes Hermione's lips as her breasts enlarge. She pinches a nipple and shudders from the sensation. "Oh fuck, too bad it's only temporary. Now, fuck me. Take me. Please." \n  Hermione gets down on all fours and raises her ass up in the air. I step forward and slap my cock on her ass and give one of her ass cheeks a nice resounding smack. She whimpers and quivers before pushing her hips back, as though hoping to force me into her. \n  I consider teasing her until she locks me with a stern look that I realize could be dangerous while she's still wrestling with these new feelings. \n  I go to slid my cock in her pussy, and she surprisingly drops her hips. "My ass, please... 'Lubrioso'" \n  I pause for a second before pushing my cock against her backdoor. It slides in and we both moan from the sensation. I begin to pound away at her ass, while her enlarged breasts sway beneath her. Soon she's panting and pushing back with such force that I have to brace myself. \n  She erupts, cumming from being taken anally, and her ass contracting around my cock sends me over as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5256A;While Hermione climaxed, she's still frustrated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5257;I agree to the offer and Hermione squeals with excitement as she grabs my hand and leads me to the bedroom. She tears my clothes of with such hunger, that I begin to wonder if I made a mistake agreeing to this. \n  As soon as we're both naked, she tackles me, landing on top of me. Hermione is already panting from excitement as she rubs her body on top of mine. Her skin is so soft, and her body is so sensitive to the touch, that I'm able to get some semblance of control by caressing, tugging, kissing, and pushing upon her body until I'm finally on top of her. As soon as I let up though, she regains her strength, making it an odd sensual wrestling match. \n  Hermione is so sensitive that bringing her to a climax isn't too difficult. The hard part is how I can't ease up as she quickly winds back up. And I'm not getting ignored in all of this. I know I've climaxed twice now, but my knees and arms feel weak, my tongue actually aches, and my hips might be bruised from an extreme grinding earlier. \n  After another thirty minutes I can barely keep my eyes open. Hermione appears to be tiring as well, although she can still move. I on the other hand can do little more than lay by her side and place soft kisses upon her breasts. It's been an extreme session, and I cannot wait for sleep to take me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5257A;In the end, Hermione is barely sated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5260;I'm on the way to my room when I hear a slightly unhinged laugh, which is clearly Hermione. Investigating, I find Hermione covered with sweat and bodily juices as she's straddling a young woman who appears to be completely spent and who's glistening herself from sweat and various juices. \n  "Oh, my liege. Isn't she the cutest morsel? She was so kind in helping me focus. And our little session was so energetic that I've managed to gather our joining to finish off this little love potion. It's yours if you want it. Otherwise I think I'll use it here on my new friend." \n  Curious, I ask Hermione what her potion would do. Apparently, my target would only need to consume the potion and they'd recognize me as their love. It apparently can even loosen the resolve of one who is chaste or swore to celibacy. A powerful potion to be sure. \n  NOTE: Target your desired love to see if you can convince them to drink it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5260A;Thank you for the potion Hermione.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5260B;It's yours to use as you wish Hermione.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5261.0;I go to visit with [dw_love_potion_target.GetBestName], bringing with me a bottle of their favorite drink. \n  [dw_love_potion_target.GetFirstName] is surprised to see me, yet is welcoming and cordial to the unexpected visit. I inquire as to some cups in order to enjoy the drink I brought. \n  Some cups are brought out, and while maintaining small talk, I pour each of us a drink. The only difference is a little sleight of hand, and I've added the love potion that Hermione gave me to theirs. \n  Cups in hand, our conversation continues and I watch as they take a drink. The effect appears to be almost instant, as the eyes focus upon me, with a whole new hunger to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

I try not to tense up as I wait to see if they take a drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Certainly they didn't see me add the love potion to their drink. I try not to tense up as I wait to see if they take a drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5261A;My success is assured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5261B;The odds seem to be in my favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5261C;It's a toss up as to whether this will work or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5266;Having allowed Hermione to use her love potion as she pleases, I discover that her selected partner is a young wizard herself named Ginny. \n  I also notice that Ginny is completely smitten by Hermione, and she has trouble keeping her hands to herself when Hermione introduces her to me. Ginny apparently lacks the skill and potential that Hermione has, which is why she was never offered up as a Court Wizard option from the Wizard's Tower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5266A;Welcome to my court Ginny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5267;Having allowed Hermione to use her love potion as she pleases, I discover that her selected partner is a young wizard herself named Luna. \n  It's a little awkward as I notice Luna muttering to herself as she stares longingly at Hermione. Hermione doesn't seem to notice it at all as she introduces Luna to me. Luna apparently is somewhat insane, which is why she was never offered up as a Court Wizard option from the Wizard's Tower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_wizardtower5267A;Welcome to my court Luna.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
