dw_grandinn100;I arrive at the inn and find that the common room is pretty empty of clientele. While not ideal for an establishment that I've invested in, I suppose I could consider investing in it some more if I want to see a more stable customer level.\n  At least my preferred spot is available. After having a seat, I scan the room to see if I overlooked anyone when the waitress stops by.\n  "Good evening [ROOT.GetTitledFirstName]. Can I get something for you to drink or eat, on the house of course?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_grandinn100a;I'll enjoy a quiet drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_grandinn110;I arrive at the inn and find that the common room has a number of customers, all who seem to be enjoying a quiet relaxing evening of drink and food. I nod in acknowledgement towards a couple patrons that look my way before resuming their meals.\n  I notice my preferred spot is available. After having a seat, I'm soon visited by the waitress.\n  "Good evening [ROOT.GetTitledFirstName]. Can I get something for you to drink or eat, on the house of course?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_grandinn120;As I approach the inn, I can hear the buzz of lively conversation within its walls. Upon entering, I find it packed with a variety of clientele, from all walks of life. I won't be able to enjoy a quiet drink tonight, yet I have to admit the energy in the place is contagious.\n  I see my normal spot has been claimed by others. Scanning the room in search of a place to sit, I notice the waitress wave and motion towards a spot at the bar.\n  Seeing little in other options, I make my way up to the bar and I take a seat. The bartender sets a mug in front of another patron and then turns towards me.\n  "Good evening [ROOT.GetTitledFirstName]. Can I get something for you to drink or eat, on the house of course?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_grandinn120a;I'll take a drink and meal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_grandinn120b;Look around the room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_grandinn130;I look around the lively room and I notice a spot with a couple splintered stool and what looks like a spilled tankard or two. Noticing where I'm looking, the bartender speaks up.\n  "Had a bit of a disagreement tonight we did. Happens with a lively group like this from time to time. Thankfully it didn't catch on and pull everyone into it. Twas just a pair o' mates that the guard drug off after they knocked each other near senseless."\n  The bartender sets up another drink for me before leaning in closer.\n  "Guard left their coin pouches behind ta handle any repairs. Since ye funded the place, I suppose it's your call if you want it for yourself or if we use it as the guard said.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_grandinn130a;I'll take it all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_grandinn130b;I'll take half.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_grandinn130c;Use it all for any repairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_grandinn140;As I look around the inn, I notice a wandering bard take position in the center of the room. A few of the clientele notice, until the Bard belts out a short energetic drinking song.\n  This gains the attention of most of the bar patrons, one of which I notice is [dw_bar_patron.GetFirstName]. A waitress brings the bard a mug, and with a nod of thanks, he takes a quick drink.\n  Thirst addressed, the bard goes right into a tale, one that's mixed with humor and more than one innuendo. Many of the listeners are enjoying his tale, one of which is [dw_bar_patron.GetFirstName].\n  With the tale done, the Bard moves into another drinking song, one with a catchy chorus that many in the inn belt out as well.\n  The performance goes on for a good hour before the man bows and excuses himself, while many in the inn applaud him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_grandinn140a;I tip the Bard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_grandinn140b;Bravo! Very Entertaining.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_grandinn140c;Boo! Bards Suck!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_grandinn150;I look around and find my eyes drawn to woman clad in what looks like yellow and green attire. The attire forms to her shape much more than what one typically sees. So much so that I swear I can see camel toe.\n  "Don't stare too long sugah."\n  I realize that my assessment of her clothing has caught her attention. I introduce myself and offer to buy a refill of what she's drinking. She gives me a smile and nods in agreement.\n  I find that the young woman is named Anna Marie, although she prefers the name Rogue. I point out that not many would admit to such a nick name openly, but she just shrugs and says her step mom gave her the name as a child.\n  It turns out Rogue is easy to talk to, and time quickly passes. I learn that she's a traveling warrior, who's lived a rather mercenary existence up to this point. She's made more than one comment about how nice the inn is, and I get the impression she's looking for a place to call home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_grandinn150a;You should join my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_grandinn150b;Good luck in your journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_grandinn150c;I don't want to see you again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
