DWNeko11;My great grandfather visited the Far East when he was a young man, and returned with my great grandmother. Many said that she was a spirit in human form, and she apparently caused more than one issue that required great grandfather to smooth out due to her not understanding customs. \n  I'm told that it was a full moon the night of my birth, and at first it was believed that my mother had laid with a werewolf thanks to my small tail and feline ears. Soon, it was realized instead that I was a rarity, having somehow shown bloodline traits of my great grandmother. \n  While growing up, I found it difficult to find interest in boring things that they kept trying to teach me, and I was told my behavior wasn't befitting a noble on so many occasions. \n  Now fate has somehow put me in charge of my own realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWNeko11A;I suppose suppose I can rule. Until I'm too bored anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DWNeko15A;I suppose I'll try this ruler thing though. Oh... Is that a ball of yarn?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
