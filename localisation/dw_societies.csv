## Society Event Related
DWSOC1610;As an Archmage, I'm properly viewed as not only a leader, but an expert within our society. While there are those who are able to seek my counsel. Not all have that luxury. Therefore, it falls upon me to impart my knowledge and push the boundaries of what we know through compiling a tome of arcane theory. \n  This is no small undertaking, as it not only will help shape the future of our society, but it'll also be a part of my legacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC1610A;This tome shall be one of my finest works.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC1900;Our society has found that within all of us, lies a lock of sorts. A lock that seems to be meant to prevent the inadvertent channelling of arcane powers. Whether the lock was placed there by the gods, or if its something that we've evolved to contain as a means of protecting ourselves is a hotly discussed topic.\n  Especially since unlocking our potential can lead to a corruption of our mind or physical well being as we call forth the arcane. Our order has attempted to limit the damage by only offering knowledge of the ritual to those who've grown beyond the Apprentice rank. We also have sought to determine the powers boundaries, or at least forms and techniques by which it can be called upon more safely.\n  Still, it is a risk to unlock one's potential. I'm now able to make such a decision myself. To open myself to the arcane powers, or remaining safely secure while broadening my knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC1900A;I am ready to begin awakening my arcane connection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC1900B;The risks outweigh the rewards. I shall not awaken my arcane connection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC1902;I'm at the key juncture for unlocking the potential within me. To open myself to channelling the arcane, I must know myself and my current limitations. Only through this self-knowledge may I transcend my current state and open myself to untold horizons.\n  I can sense the lock within me becoming weaker. As it weakens, I feel a rising energy within my chest. Those who've shared their experiences indicate the sensation is different for everyone. To some, it's a searing heat, others it's an uncomfortable chill, while some say it's like an internal itch that can't be scratched.\n  This is the critical step. As the sensation builds, the lock will soon be undone and I'll be flooded with power that will need to be turned off through my will - creating a mentally controlled door rather than a lock that isn't meant to be opened. Failure risks me losing my mind or severe physical harm.\n  I shall succeed. I've come to far to fail. I focus on the sensation that is building within my chest and I prepare to seize control once the lock is broken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC1902A;The sensation rages like an inferno.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC1902B;The sensation chills me to the bone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC1902C;The sensation is a maddening itch within me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC1902D;I shall bask in the power before closing the door.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC1903;When the lock breaks, I fight against the desire to bathe in the power and instead remain true to the teachings as I seek to erect and close a mental door on the source of the arcane channel within me. The sensation seems to surge, in an attempt to distract me from my course of action. I let the sensation pass over me, ignoring it as I push the door close to save myself from the onslaught of power.\n  Once the door closes, the sensation quickly begins fading away. As it does so, I can feel my senses are very acute right now. I steady my breathing and notice that instead of being fatigued from such a gruelling ordeal, that the energy seems to have revitalized me.\n  With a sigh I open my eyes. I stand with a smile as I dust off my garments. Today is a new day, and instead of being bed ridden and recovering. I'm well enough to go forward and enjoy it and the work that I've done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC1903A;I have successfully become a mage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC1905;When the lock breaks, I feel a torrent of power rush into me. I furrow my brow and grit my teeth as I accept it charging through me.\n  The feeling is intoxicating! My body feels so alive, I can feel the air dancing across my flesh and my vision sees the world in a kaleidoscope of colors. The hairs on my arms dance as though they seek to escape my flesh, and my ears hear voices whispering secrets among the raging arcane torrent passing through me.\n  The fools and their recommended 'safe' approach. I'm better than they. I do not fear the power. I shall be the one to control it, and not let it control me!\n  I see the crack in the floor before it happens. A loud crack and the room shudders. I consider letting the power continue to flood outwards as the voices within it desire. Yet I am the master, not they.\n  So I reign the power in, shoving it into place until I so choose to call upon it. It resists, and it proves a worthy adversary, yet it ultimately relents. Leaving me panting in the middle of my chamber.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC1905A;I am a true mage who can wield this power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7050;There is a risk in dealing with powers that we cannot properly accommodate for. Be it our mental stability, or a toll upon our mortal shell. I can tell I'm changing, and I fear it's not for the better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7050A;Perhaps this is just who I truly am?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7824;I introduce [From.GetFullName] to the rest of my court.\n  I won't be surprised if there are some who have concerns about my newest addition, yet having a valuable resource and loyal society brethren is another ally that I can rely on furthering my goals.\n  Praise Mother Lilith for we are her Chosen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7824A;I welcome my loyal servant to my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC91;Your interest has been noticed.\n  Interest in itself is only the first step. Journey to the tavern at the edge of town in a week's time, alone and incognito.\n  There, an agent shall contact you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC91A;Contact, at last. I shall be there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC91B;This sounds like a trap. I'll not attend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC100.0;I take a seat at a table in the corner as I await my contact. A barmaid brings over a tankard and places it on the table, its contents foaming over. She leans forward, giving me a clear view of her cleavage.\n  "What have we here? An orphan in search of it's mother?"\n  I look the tavern wench over intently. I understand that Lilith is viewed as a mother to many. I lick my lips in anticipation and nod in acknowledgement of her question.\n  "Is that so?" Her eyes seem to sparkle. She bites her lip and lets a small drop of blood fall into the tankard of ale. Her lips twist in a maniacal smile as she slides the tankard of ale over.\n  "Know that my Mother sees through me. My blood carries her gift of judgement. If you hold true desire or love for my Mother, then drink up and see if she accepts you. If she does not, your end will be a painful one."\n  I look at the foaming tankard and notice that it seems to boil with an unnatural fervor. I meet the gaze of the emissary. I can drink and accept the judgement or leave now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC100.1;I enter the tavern and find it filled with people. The room is warm and inviting, yet I find that I pull my cloak tightly about myself, as I was expecting a shadowy corner table to locate myself at.\n "Oh excuse me. We're a little full right now here in our common room. You look like you'd prefer another location."\n  I look at the barmaid that is addressing me. Her smile is genuine, yet I feel an itch at the back of my skull. I take my eyes away and quickly look about the room once more. I see no free spot, yet tonight is the night.\n  A soft hand tugs upon my sleeve. I turn to find the barmaid's smile. "You don't belong here. Do you? This place doesn't hold that which you seek, does it?"\n  Thoughts of what I expected from the Wizards College dance across my mind. The itch is there at the back of my mind again. I shake my head no, and quietly mutter, this place doesn't hold what I seek.\n  Her eyes sparkle. "Well then, what you want is probably through that door." She motions across the room to a door, old and gnarled, it doesn't fit this room./n  I feel it now. I can stay on course, and go through that door, or I can leave any thought of the Wizards College behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC100A;I remain true to my convictions and accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC100B;I've made a mistake and must stop now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC101.0;The ale tastes horrible as I choke it down. I feel a burning sensation arise from deep within me, and I fail to keep down a choking cough. With sweat beading down my forehead, the burning sensation passes. I look up and see the tavern wench smiling at me.\n  "Well, well. You may be one of my kin after all. You've passed the Mother's first, and dare I say most important test. Rest and rule. Another shall seek you out in due time."\n  With a wink she saunters off back towards the bar, leaving me to my thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC101.1;I go through the door and find that I'm outside, in the morning, with what looks my estate before me. To the left, against a dark hole is a dark skinned robed figure.\n  "Welcome [Root.GetFirstName]. You took steps forward, ignoring the warnings inherit to us all, and stepped through an out of place door in search of answers."\n  The figure turn his head slowly, his white eyes showing him as being blind, yet I clearly feel his gaze upon me.\n  "Just know that this was the first test. Another shall come to you in the future. Be prepared."\n  The figure says nothing else. I feel myself get a little faint, and as I shake it off, I find that the man and the hole are gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC101A;I look forward to the next contact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC102.0;I don't know how long the cloaked figure was standing there, in the corner of my study, staring at me from the shadows. But as soon as I noticed it, the figure spoke.\n  "You should feel blessed child. The moment of your acceptance is at hand. Come with me to complete your joining. Or turn away now and forget what shadows you've witnessed."\n  I can sense that this is the moment. If I go forward, and I don't like what I see, it could be too late to back out. Potentially making enemies of the Chosen. So if I proceed, and go with the shadowy figure, I must be certain of my resolve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC102.1;I open the door to my study, and instead of seeing what I expect, I find myself instead viewing an elderly man looking through a large tome.\n  "Ah. I see you've arrived. It took you long enough. A full day I suppose to have kept me waiting."\n  I open my mouth to answer and am instead greeted with a dismissive wave of his hand. "Bah, now I'm wasting time as well. What's important is to know if you're worthy or not I suppose. So I have for you a simple test. Although I suppose it isn't really a test, but instead a choice. I've two pills for you. The red one will provide you entry into our order, should you survive its effects - as some have perished when taking it. The blue one gives you an out from our order. It has no ill effect, other than clouding your recollection of our interactions, and signals an end to your interest. What shall be your decision?"\n  I feel a faint bead of sweat form as I consider my options before responding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC102A;I will not back out now. I accept all that is required.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC102B;I've made a mistake. I shall abandon my pursuit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC102C;Your statement implies, yet doesn't limit. So I say neither.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC102D;I choose the Red Pill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC102E;I choose the Blue Pill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC104.0;I follow the cloaked figure out into the night, where we stand under a new moon. Turning towards me, the cloaked figure spreads their arms out wide.\n  "Child of Mother Lilith. You already bear her mark, and are given membership without trial. Under the gaze of this new moon, the Mother sees you, and the Chosen of Lilith welcome you."\n  I blink in surprise. I confirm that this is really all there is to it, and the cloaked figure makes it known that my blood lineage is considered adequate. So I inquire about what trial I would have faced if I wasn't already a Succubus.\n  "If you were not already a child of Mother Lilith, we would have called to consummate your joining the order, with you taking the seed of multiple members into your womb. And while it's not necessary, if you so wish, we could still follow through with the act."\n  So I'm in either way, the only question is if I want my belly filled with the spunk of strangers or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC104.1;I follow the cloaked figure out into the night, where we stand under a new moon. Turning towards me, the cloaked figure spreads their arms out wide.\n  "Child of Mother Lilith.

I confirm that this is really all there is to it, and the cloaked figure makes it known that my blood lineage is considered adequate. So I inquire about what trial I would have faced if I wasn't already an Incubus.\n  "If you were not already a child of Mother Lilith, we would have needed proof of your subservience. We would have bound you, and then to consummate your joining the order, we would have you taken by multiple members who would use you for their release. And while it's not necessary, if you so wish, we could still follow through with the act."\n  So I'm in either way, the only question is if I want to be bound and used by a bunch of strangers or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC104A;I am one of the Chosen of Lilith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC104B;You know, the night is still young...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC105.0;I follow the cloaked figure, and I feel my body tingle from excitement over what I'm about to do. I lick my lips in anticipation as we approach a small home. As he opens the door, and I step through, my arousal to the point where my nipples are firm and wish to be free, while my pussy juices have begun to flow.\n  Inside the dimly lit room is a simple bed and a group of naked men, each with their cock in hand, stroking while looking upon me with lust. My body shivers in anticipation as I gaze upon their engorged members. My eyes locked on their cocks, I feel the cloaked figures hands on me, peeling my clothing off and exposing my body.\n  "I hope you find them pleasing. They have been carefully selected for their endurance and quantity of seed."\n  Free of my clothing, I stand there naked before them, my nipples stiff and my skin yearning to be touched.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC105.1;I follow the cloaked figure out into the night. We make our way to a small home on the outskirts of town. He pauses by the door and looks around as if to ensure there are no witnesses. He opens the door and motions for me to enter into the dimly lit room.\n  I step through the doorway, my eyes taking just a moment to adjust to the change in light. It's a simple room, with a rough bed and a strong smell of musk in the air. We're not alone, as a group of men, all naked with their cocks in the hand are looking at me as they stroke their members.\n I tense as I hear the door shut behind me. "Mother Lilith wishes to consummate your joining our ranks. These men have all been especially chosen based on their endurance and quantity of seed."\n  My mind is swimming with what is about to happen, when I gasp as the hands of the cloaked man begins to remove my clothing. As my flesh is bared before them, I watch as their cocks stiffen even further. Soon, I'm naked before them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC105A;I climb on the bed and motion for them to join me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC106.0;The men join me on the bed and soon I'm covered in hands touching, probing, pulling, and pinching my flesh. I moan with hunger as I surrender my body to their manipulations.\n  I gasp as the first man enters me, sliding in cleanly thanks to my wet pussy's arousal. Another cock slaps my cheek and I reflexively turn my head and flick my tongue across it's tip. I feel hands slip around the back of my skull and I open my mouth to take in his member as he pulls my head to his groin.\n Soon, I'm rolled over to where I'm straddling a man while riding his cock. I feel another tip poke my asshole. I relax and moan around the cock in my mouth as I push back to accept the new cock into my ass.\n  The rotation lasts for a couple hours, with each taking multiple turns with me. It's wonderful, and when they're finally laying spent around me, I feel stronger from the energy that they shared with me.\n  I trace a finger up my inner thigh to catch some of the semen trying to escape, and I lick it from my finger. Grinning widely, I dress before departing back to my home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC106.1;The men join me on the bed and soon I'm covered in hands touching, probing, pulling, and pinching my flesh. I tremble as my body is overwhelmed with the attention. I can almost feel their hunger for my body.\n  My hands are guided to grasp hard members, while I'm pulled atop another man, who grinds his groin against me, and I feel my pussy tingle from the sensation. Another cock slaps my cheek and I turn my head to gaze upon the impressive member. He guides my face towards his cock, and open my mouth to accept it. \n The man beneath me lifts me slightly, and then guides me onto him. His grinding has stimulated my pussy to where my juices allow me to accept him without much pain. Once I sink down, he begins thrusting while I try to get my timing down to ride his cock.\n  Soon, I feel another tip poke my asshole. I tense and am told that it would be best for me to relax. I try to do so as I feel it push into me, the pain quickly getting lost in the pleasure and stimulation I'm experiencing. The rotation lasts for a couple hours, with each taking multiple turns with me.\n  Later, I find myself laying amongst them. They're all spent, and I'm a little sore, yet I must admit it was pleasurable. I quietly dress before departing back to my home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC106A;I join the Chosen with a womb full of seed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC112;I awake to the sound of birds singing their morning song outside of my bedroom window. I cover my eyes from the rising sunlight slipping into my room.\n  My mind dances as I try to recall something that feels like a fading dream. I do my best to focus on the features of an individual as the thought fades from memory, and end up instead breathing deeply from the sharp pain that shoots through my head.\n  I lay there for a bit longer, letting the headache subside, until it's finally gone. I realize also that the details of my dream are also lost, yet a part of me is uncomfortable, as though some foreboding warning has now been lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC112A;What a nightmare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC111;As soon as I swallow the small red pill, my throat feels as though it is on fire. I open my mouth and find that I'm unable to make a sound or breathe.\n  "You've just consumed a portion of mana, arcane energy which has been extracted from a variety of sources. It's lethal to many who consume it, and can cripple those who survive. The secret to you surviving will be your ability to exert your will over your body. Forcing it to continue to function while the energy within the pill dissipates within you."\n  I do my best to quell the panic within me while willing my body to take a breath. I somehow manage to take a breath, and my chest feels like it's about to burst. I try to continue breathing, when my ears begin ringing so loudly that I want to scream. I clasp my hands over them, while fighting a scream, as I feel to do so would render me unable to breathe.\n  I steal a glance at the man, he's watching me calmly, with a measured gaze. I fall to my knees before him, as my body begins to convulse. I grit my teeth, sucking in a vital breath as the man leans closer to observe me.\n  "About a tenth of the way through I'd wager."\n  I fight the urge to surrender, and I continue my battle with my body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC111A;I have survived and am now in the Wizard's College.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC111B;I have failed. Death embraces me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC110;The elderly man stares at me for a moment before nodding in what seems to be approval.\n  "We often make decisions based upon facts or parameters provided by others. Limited thinking that reduces innovation. It is good to see that you are one who sees options that are not provided by others. It also saves me considerable time. Welcome to the Wizard's College."\n  I ask a few more questions, and receive some short answers regarding rules and expectations. Until with a sigh, the elderly man motions for me to leave through the doorway that I came through. Upon walking through it, I find myself standing back in my hallway, outside of the door to my study.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC110A;I am now a member of the Wizard's College.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC107.0;I follow the cloaked figure, and I feel my body tremble in anticipation of what's to come. I tug at my cloak in anticipation as we approach a small home on the outskirts of town. As he opens the door, and I step through into a dimly lit room, my heart racing from what is to come.\n  Inside I find a simple bed and a group of rough looking men who immediately come forward and grab my arms. I'm pulled into the center of the room, where another pulls out a length of fine black rope and another steps forward with some interesting blackened manacles. Pressure to the back of my knee brings me down. As I fall, firm hands pull away my cloak and tear away my clothing, leaving my upper body exposed. My arms are pulled upward and a manacle attached to each wrist. There are no chains on them, yet I quickly see the intent, as the rope is pulled through, and with movements that show a measure of practice, it isn't long before my arms are bound behind me and I'm largely at the mercy of the men around me.\n  I'm pulled upright and then pushed on the bed where my belt and pants are pulled off, leaving me bound and naked on the bed. With a grunt of apparent satisfaction, the robed men begin to shed their clothing, and soon I'm surrounded, prone on the bed between large rough looking men with a wild glint in their eyes and cocks that are raising up to point at me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC107.1;I follow the cloaked figure out into the night. We keep to the shadows as we cross town. I remain silent, pondering what to expect. A secret ritual? Some test of confidence? Mind mind rolls through the possibilities in anticipation of what's to come.\n  As we approach a small home on the outskirts of town, he stops and scans the area quickly, as if to ensure we weren't followed. Without a word, he opens the door, and I step through into a dimly lit room.\n  Inside I find a simple bed and a group of rough looking men who immediately come forward and grab my arms. Fear races through me, as I wonder if it's a trap or some other test. My moment of hesitation is broken as I'm pulled into the center of the room and then kicked in the back of the knees, causing me to collapse on the floor. Firm hands pull away my cloak and tear away my clothing while my arms are pulled in opposite directions by those with a hold on me. I try to resist as fear seizes me, until a knee slams into the back of my head, causing my vision to blur. In my stunned moment, I feel the cold, metallic sensation of manacles placed on my wrists. I tug again reflexively, and the knee presses into my back, while another hand pulls my head backwards, with my arms outstretched, I've no leverage to resist.\n  "Man. Headstrong and willful. These traits serve us well in the world, yet before Mother Lilith, she demands obedience."\n  I see the meaning in the words and cease my struggles. It isn't long before my arms are bound behind me, with my upper body exposed.  I'm pulled upright and then pushed on the bed where my belt and pants are pulled off, leaving me bound and naked on the bed. With a grunt of apparent satisfaction, the robed men begin to shed their clothing, and soon I'm surrounded, prone on the bed between large rough looking men with a wild glint in their eyes and cocks that are raising up to point at me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC107A;I lay there, awaiting what comes next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC108.0;The men descend upon me, pawing and prodding me. One slaps his cock on my cheek and orders me to service his cock. His musky smell is overwhelming, yet I obediently obey as I open my mouth and flick my tongue across the tip. I focus on both stimulating and lubricating his cock as I know what's coming. Sure enough, I feel his hand grab the back of my head, as he shoves his hips forward, ramming his cock into my mouth and down my throat.\n  While I'm being throat fucked, the other men have been trying to figure out who's going to take my ass first apparently. Upon hearing there is a victor, I lift up my legs in an attempt to roll my hips to make my ass more accessible. The men adjust me a bit further and I then feel something cool and slimy, some kind of grease perhaps, rubbed around my asshole. A pair of fingers push into my ass, lubing my hole and I moan around the cock in my mouth. Soon, the fingers are removed and a few moments later, I feel a man's cock seeking entrance. I relax and with a slow deliberate push, he sinks in deeply. I give into the sensation of being spit-roasted, and enjoy the night.\n  I awake in the morning, free of my bonds. The men are sleeping throughout the room, their snores breaking the silence. An interesting night indeed, and one that I imagine most males who desire to join the Chosen would find disturbing. Alas, it was just what I needed for the night. I put on a cloak to cover myself before departing, and then head back to my home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC108.1;The men descend upon me, pawing and prodding me. One slaps his cock on my cheek and orders me to service his cock. His musky smell is overwhelming, and I turn my head away. I then yelp as my cock is slapped.\n  "You can do what we say, or you can resist and we get rough. Either's fine, and personally, I'm hoping you resist a bit more."\n  I'm in no position to resist, and it's clear that continued non-compliance will result in my getting beaten severely. Not something I want to have to explain in court. Resigning myself to the situation, I turn my head back towards the waiting cock. I push out the scent before me and open my mouth to service the man.\n  The remaining men hike my legs up and shift my ass near the end of the bed, while I'm doing my best to not gag as my mouth and throat is being fucked. I tense as a pair of finger push into my asshole. The sensation is both painful and... not bad. The fingers slide out, and I can tell that some kind of oil or grease was just generously applied from the probing. There is some motion and the sound of one of the men claiming victory, as he apparently won the opportunity to go first. I know what's coming, and I do my best to relax and take it all..\n  I awake in the morning, free of my bonds. The men are sleeping throughout the room, their snores breaking the silence. Do all males who desire to join the Chosen have to go through such a test? I imagine most would find disturbing. Rubbing the back of my head where I was kneed when I struggled, I wonder how many fought further and didn't heed the call to obedience. Unable to answer the questions, I put on a cloak to cover myself before departing. Then with one final glance, at those who had their way with me, I turn and head back to my home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC108A;I'm one of the Chosen of Lilith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7250;Hey there loyal Chosen. I've a job for you.\n   - Construct a place of worship to Lilith.\n  Yes, I understand that such worship is typically seen by the general masses as undesired, yet it is still important that we pay homage to Mother Lilith. So be intelligent about it, and ensure that it is somewhere where you and other faithful can find it, while fools cannot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOCACCEPT;I accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOCDECLINE;I decline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7255.0;My task is constructing a place of worship to Lilith. A challenge when considering that the general populace are fools who would cry heresy at such worship. So the location of worship must be discrete./n  I could seek to keep the location close to me, having a hidden room constructed. I could also just use an existing room, and declare it isn't to be used without my permission, for what ruler couldn't use a place of solitude. Of course Mother Lilith also wandered and lived off the lands, so perhaps something more natural would work. Something that could be visited by the faithful, and if found it wouldn't be associated with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7255.1;My task is constructing a place of worship to Lilith. A challenge when considering that the general populace are fools who would cry heresy at such worship. So the location of worship must be discrete./n  I could seek to keep the location close to me, having a chest constructed that could be stored on my wagon, and erected when necessary. Of course Mother Lilith also wandered and lived off the lands, so perhaps something more natural would work. Something that could be visited by the faithful, and if found it wouldn't be associated with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7255A;I'll add a secret room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7255B;I'll construct a shrine in the wilderness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7255C;I'll construct a portable shrine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7255D;I'll dedicate space within my private chambers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7260;I've worked with a pair of builders known for their discretion. The end result is a secret room that only I, and those in my society who I share the information with, shall be able to access.\n  A secret location where we can give thanks to and worship Lilith properly. All the room needs now is to be outfitted with items. Things like statuettes, incense, candles, glyphs or runes, and other ritual symbolism to both show my devotion and strengthen the message of worship to Mother Lilith.\n  Of course that will require money. After considering my desires and my treasury, I make my decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7260A;Elaborate quality items.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7260B;Moderate quality items.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7260C;Minor quality items.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7260D;Whatever is on hand already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7270;I was tasked with constructing a place of worship to Mother Lilith. A location that I and other society members could utilize that were in the area. I've completed my task and I am pleased to have the opportunity to use it now in giving thanks to Mother Lilith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7270A;Praise Mother Lilith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7262;I've taken the time to travel around and visit locations in the wilderness, and I've finally found an ideal location. It's outside of frequently travelled paths, it provides a measure protection from the weather, and brings a measure of authenticity based on the effort to visit it. The result is a location that I and those in my society who I share the information with, shall be able to locate and worship at.\n  This hidden location where we can give thanks to and worship Lilith properly now only needs to be outfitted with items of worship. Things like statuettes, incense, candles, glyphs or runes, and other ritual symbolism to both show my devotion and strengthen the message of worship to Mother Lilith.\n  Of course that will require money. After considering my desires and my treasury, I make my decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7264;I had a trustworthy person who has some skill with carpentry, craft a sturdy chest for me. One in which I can store the items commonly associated with worshipping Lilith. I shall erect it when we stop and make our temporary settlement, and I shall break it down and pack it back up when it's time to travel once more. Giving me and those in my society who may visit a location to worship at.\n  All the chest needs now is to be outfitted with items. Things like statuettes, incense, candles, glyphs or runes, and other ritual symbolism to both show my devotion and strengthen the message of worship to Mother Lilith.\n  Of course that will require money. After considering my desires and my treasury, I make my decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7266;I've moved things around in my personal chambers to make an area that is worthy of being made into a shrine. It's not visible from the doorway, so anyone passing by shouldn't notice it without inappropriately entering my chambers. The end result is a place where I and those in my society who I permit entrance with, shall be able to access for worship.\n  Here we can give thanks to and worship Lilith properly. All the little shrine needs now is to be outfitted with items. Things like statuettes, incense, candles, glyphs or runes, and other ritual symbolism to both show my devotion and strengthen the message of worship to Mother Lilith.\n  Of course that will require money. After considering my desires and my treasury, I make my decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7100;There are risks to dealing with unnatural powers. Yet those risks are not without the chance of rewards.\n  While I cannot point to a singular event, I awake today and clearly feel different than I did yesterday. And unlike many who are burnt by this path and weakened, I instead feel as though I've improved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7100A;My true potential awakens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7500;As [From.GetTitledFirstName] is bound to the altar [From.GetSheHe] appears to be mumbling prayers through [From.GetHerHis] gag. [From.GetSheHeCap] is sweating profusely, either due to the heat from the nearby lit braziers or from fear. [From.GetHerHisCap] clothing hangs in tatters, exposing [From.GetHerHis] chest.\n  As the appointed hour draws near my brethren begin their chanting. It begins quietly and builds slowly into a crescendo until, finally, it is time.\n  I gaze down upon the sacrifice as I raise the blade above their chest. [From.GetHerHisCap] eyes are wide with disbelief and they shake their head as if to dispel a bad dream. With a grin, I bring the blade down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7500A;Praise Mother Lilith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7506;You struggle against the bonds holding you to the altar, but there is no give in them. As the unholy chanting rises to a frantic crescendo, you see [From.GetTitledFirstName] walking towards you holding a dagger. You redouble your efforts to escape, but [From.GetTitledFirstName] is already raising [From.GetHerHis] dagger over [From.GetHerHis] head in a two-handed grip. You have time to realize the rope around your right hand is starting to loosen just before [From.GetTitledFirstName] blade slams into your heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7506A;Nooooooo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7001;[dw_chosen_recruiter.GetFirstName] asks me about some alternative views on the world and religion in general.\n  If I didn't know better, I'd say they were probing me to potentially join some kind of secret society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7001A;It just so happens that I share similar thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7001B;Begone with your sacrilegious questions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7008;I'm visited again by [dw_chosen_recruiter.GetFirstName]. They bring up their alternate views once more, and speak to the advantages of being with other like minded individuals who also share the same or similar views. I agree to the advantages, and after another hour of discussing various topics, I'm invited to join them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7008A;I'm now a member of the Chosen of Lilith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7009;I've received a confirmation from [dw_chosen_recruit.GetFirstName] that they are prepared to join the Chosen of Lilith. I inform my brethren and in the evening we hold a ceremony to bring them into the fold.\n  As we grow in numbers, so to does our influence upon the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7009A;Our society grows stronger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7003;The exploratory meeting with [dw_chosen_recruit.GetFirstName] was horrible. A waste of time, with a fool who is too entrenched in their ways to properly appreciate the gifts of Mother Lilith.\n  Unfortunately, a failed effort like this could also increase my exposure, so I must be careful in the months that follow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7003A;Disappointing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7002;The exploratory meeting with [dw_chosen_recruit.GetFirstName] went very well. They are open minded, willing to question the existing religious powers, and can likely appreciate the gifts of Mother Lilith.\n  Our ranks could use new members, and I see no drawbacks in proceeding forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC7002A;I shall extend an invitation to our society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC1201;[dw_wizard_recruiter.GetFirstName] asks me about some alternative views on the world, religion, and what I can only describe as the occult. The questions are largely things that would be considered heretical by most, yet they seem genuinely interested in my views.\n  If I didn't know better, I'd say they were probing me to potentially join some kind of secret society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC1201A;It just so happens that I share similar thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC1201B;Begone with your sacrilegious questions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC1208;I'm visited again by [dw_wizard_recruiter.GetFirstName]. They bring up their outlook on the typically taboo topics once more, and speak to the advantages of being with other like minded individuals who also share the same or similar views. I agree to the advantages, and after another hour of discussing various topics, I'm invited to join them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC1208A;I'm now a member of the Arcane College.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC1209;I've received a confirmation from [dw_wizard_recruit.GetFirstName] that they are prepared to join the Arcane College. I inform my brethren and in the evening we hold a ceremony to bring them into the fold.\n  As we grow in numbers, so to does our influence upon the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC1209A;Our society grows stronger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC1203;The exploratory meeting with [dw_wizard_recruit.GetFirstName] was horrible. A waste of time, with a fool who is too entrenched in their ways to properly appreciate the knowledge that awaits us out there. Instead they are more comfortable remaining true to the established norms of society.\n  Unfortunately, a failed effort like this could also increase my exposure, so I must be careful in the months that follow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC1203A;Disappointing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC1202;The exploratory meeting with [dw_wizard_recruit.GetFirstName] went very well. They are open minded, willing to question the boundaries of what is known in order to find the hidden truths or the questions that are as of yet unanswered. Their mindset is one that can likely appreciate the risks and benefits of pursuing such knowledge, like my other brethren in the Arcane College.\n  Our ranks could use new members, and I see no drawbacks in proceeding forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWSOC1202A;I shall extend an invitation to our society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
