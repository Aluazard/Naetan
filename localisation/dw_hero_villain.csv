# Events
dw_hvevents03;A named NPC from the Heroes and Villains mod has died.\n  If it is someone you recruited, you should be able to now recruit a replacement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents03a;Understood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents10;The world is entering an age of extremes. A complacent middle ground is beginning to vanish, leaving two extremes.\n  On one extreme, you've individuals who have decided that they shall achieve what they wish using any means necessary. Be it monetary greed, a simple lust for power, or something more complex. These individuals are recognized as Villains.\n  Then you've those who've risen in opposition. These Heroes are typically known for their fairness, the value of their word, and commonly serve as protectors.\n  With the world already filled with conflict, will these individuals cause the fall of humanity, or shall they prevent it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents10a;Become a hero;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents10b;Become a villain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents10c;I shall avoid choosing sides for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents20;I invoke the hidden powers that shape this world! Heed my call and shape thine destiny as I dictate!\n\n  Respawn: When a non-generic NPC made by this game dies, certain flags get cleared that allow the method used to get them previously, to happen again. Allowing recruited characters to be recruited again, and those who came via events to potentially be found through those events again.\n  This is on by default. Turning Respawn off, means that once a non-generic NPC dies, they're gone for good. Once off, anyone who dies is still lost forever. Turning it back on is NOT retroactive, so prior dead are still gone. Turning it back on, only provides respawn capability for those still alive or as of yet unobtained.\n\n  Bestiality is turned OFF by default. Turning it on, means those events may trigger. With it off, they won't. Note - this trigger is for this mod's content only. It doesn't stop another mod with such content from activating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents20a;Turn OFF respawn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents20b;Turn respawn back ON;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents20c;Turn ON bestiality;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents20d;Turn OFF bestiality;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents20e;More settings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents20f;All done (Exit).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents21;Symbiotes and/or Tentacle-kin are ON by default. If you don't want parasitic, corruptive entities spreading themselves among mankind, then turn it off. Or, if you turned it off, you can turn it back on to enable the spread once more. If you already have them running amok in your game world, and you want to switch it off, just give it a little time. If turned off, a decision will become available for any characters with the trait, and they'll remove it themselves. It's like you're a super mage of some kind that just purged the world of this disease!\n\n  Therianthropes are also ON by default. What's a Therianthrope? Well, it's a human with some animal spirit blood in them. Those who embrace this side of themselves can take an animal like form.  A werewolf is a type of therianthrope. If you have this set to off, some heroes or villains may be excluded (for example, Beast Boy).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents21a;Turn Symbiotes/Tentacle-Kin OFF.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents21b;Turn Symbiotes/Tentacle-Kin ON.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents21c;Turn Therianthropes OFF.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents21d;Turn Therianthropes ON.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents22;Demon-kin are ON by default. Turning this off may disable some heroes or villains (for example: Raven)\n\n  This mod has Wizard Towers you can build. So does Dark World Fantasy. I've got specific functionality tied to mine, and what I created in Dark World has been expanded upon from what I understand. If you don't want to see this mod's Wizard Towers - and you don't care about the functionality they add, then you can turn them off as Wizard Towers are ON by default.\n\n  There are no other potential settings at this time, although more may come in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dw_hvevents101;It has been brought to my attention that Harley Quinn has managed to get herself imprisoned.\n  Foolish woman. Now I'm left having to make a decision as to whether she is worth freeing or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents101a;Gee, that's too bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents101b;I shall buy her release.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents101c;Plan a prison breakout.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents102;The plan moved along quickly, and before I knew it, we were at the outer wall of the dungeon. The casks of decomposing manure were rolled up against the wall, the methane leaking out from the cracks of the cask.\n  A wild grin flashed across Harley's eyes as she watched us clear the way and pull out a torch. I had to remind her the importance of getting back, which for a moment I thought she may ignore. But then with a yelp of excitement she scrabbled out of view.\n The torch was lite and thrown, and in a flash, the barrels erupted. Chunks of dungeon wall went flying, and the cry of alarm went up. Harley stumbled out of the smoke and debris, switching between coughs and laughs. I grabbed her hand and led her to the horses nearby. As the first guards came into view, we were mounted and galloping away.\n  "BOOM! Hahahahaha. Oh, my ears are ringing! Hey my [ROOT.GetLordLady]! We might have to do that again sometime. We'd just need to find one with better food though."\n As we rode off, I found myself weighing the odds of her getting caught on purpose. When I looked over at her again, she met my gaze and gave me a wide smile, as though she knew what I was thinking about. With a chuckle, I spurred the horse faster to hasten our getaway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents102a;FREEDOM!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents103;It has been brought to my attention that Starfire has somehow been subdued and imprisoned.\n  An unfortunate turn of events. Now I'm left having to make a decision as to whether she is worth freeing or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents103a;Gee, that's too bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents103b;I shall buy her release.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents200;I'm sitting in my cell, reflecting on the chain of events that have ended with me being here in prison. The sound of my cell door unlocking pulls me from my thoughts.\n  In walks [dw_prison_host.GetBestName], the person who has me imprisoned. [dw_prison_host.GetSheHeCap] has a disturbing smile and look in their eyes.\n  "I realize that I'm not an ideal host for one as prestigious as you [ROOT.GetFirstName]. As your host, I should see that you're entertained properly. Of course, the big question, is what kid of entertainment would be best? Sure, there's one sided things like torture, but that'd be selfish. Hrm, I know, how about something a little more carnal in nature? Doesn't that sound like some good fun?"\n  [dw_prison_host.GetFirstName] seems delighted at the prospect, and something inside me seems to scream out in warning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents200a;I brace for the worst.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents200b;Let me buy my freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents210.0;I'm stripped of my clothing and bound by [dw_prison_host.GetFirstName]'s guards. I struggle during it, and all that I gain from it is a couple punches to the face.\n  Once bound, the guards leave us alone. [dw_prison_host.GetFirstName] is looking at me with a disturbing grin as he begins to disrobe. I writhe in my bonds, yet it does me little good other than pleasing my captor.\n  He strokes his hard cock as he looks at me. I threaten him, and he laughs it off. I open my mouth to challenge him, yet my words are cut short as his boot slams into my chin. I roll over from the blow, and as my head swims, I feel him grab me from behind.\n  He jams a couple fingers into my ass. It burns from the forced intrusion, yet I feel they're slick, as though covered in oil.\n  "Time to learn your place [ROOT.GetFirstName]. I'm the one who controls your ass, and if I want to dump my seed in it, it is my right."\n  His fingers are removed, and replaced with his cock. There is no warning, no concern for me. He slides it in and immediately begins fucking me hard. The pain is astonishing, and my head swims from it.\n  He mutters about how tight my ass is and how it's his turn. He chokes me as his pounding increases. I feel him explode in my ass as my vision begins to fade.\n  He releases my throat and I cough as I try to take in air.\n  "Now you'll behave, or we'll have to have this discussion again."\n  He leaves me in my cell, where I lay naked with an ass full of jizz.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents210.1;I'm stripped of my clothing and bound by [dw_prison_host.GetFirstName]'s guards. I struggle during it, and all that I gain from it is a punch in the eye and a couple kicks in my balls.\n  Once bound, the guards leave us alone. [dw_prison_host.GetFirstName] is looking at me with a disturbing grin as he begins to disrobe. I writhe in my bonds, yet it gains me little than another kick.\n  Once he's ready, I go his cruel demeanor seems to change. He ensures he's well oiled, and he massages my ass with the oil and his fingers as well. He takes his time, commenting as my body slowly betrays me from the awkward feeling and my cock stiffens.\n  He then positions me on his lap, lowering me until his cock is buried in my ass. It burns, yet also feels, different. My cock even seems to stiffen more from it.\n  "Now, I'm here to pleasure myself, you prisoner, are not allowed release."\n  He then grabs my cock, and pulls a long metal nail out from a leather sack. He slides it through oil, then after warning me to not move, less I permanently damage myself, he slides the nail into the tip of my penis, plugging my urethra with it.\n  He then uses me. Fucking me without another care until he empties his balls in my ass. The whole time, my cock continues to stand at attention, even though it all hurts.\n  Once finished, he pulls the nail out and leaves me bound with an ass full of jizz, and in pain until guards come later to release me from the bonds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents210.2;I'm stripped of my clothing by [dw_prison_host.GetFirstName]'s guards and then suspended in chains. I struggle during it, and all that I gain from it is a few punches and kicks.\n  When I'm finally hanging there, [dw_prison_host.GetFirstName] chuckles as the guards line the walls. He brings out a variety of objects, from a candle to a leather strap to some vials of liquid. I state that torturing me won't give him the satisfaction he seeks.\n  "Torture? Hahaha. I suppose it could be considered torture to a degree, but I'm actually looking more at a little humiliation. Tell me [ROOT.GetFirstName], when was the last time you got off and came in front of a room full of male spectators?"\n  I look at what he laid out again, and taken with a different light, I see that simple torture isn't his goal.\n  The next couple of hours are horrible. I wouldn't have thought it possible, but [dw_prison_host.GetFirstName] was able to have my body betray me. While there was pain, there was pleasure. I came so many times, that my balls are shriveled and empty. My ass is sore, and I can feel the oils he put inside me dribble out. My chest is covered with dried stale cum, shot out from my own cock onto myself.\n  As the guards lower me, I'm too fatigued to resist, and their laughing, taunting comments only seem to hold me down further. Once I'm dropped back in my cell, I simply curl up into a ball and fall into sleep, where nightmares now surely await me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents210a;I've been sodomized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents210b;I think I'm alright with this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents215.0;I'm stripped of my clothing and then drug over to some ceiling chains where my hands are bound. I'm then descended upon by a pair of scullery maids who wash the grime from my body, all while [dw_prison_host.GetFirstName] and a pair of guards look on. The maids end up paying specific attention to my cock and balls, and while it'd not intended, my body responds to their attention.\n  "Hah, getting hard from some low class wenches cleaning your balls? I see now why your lands lack proper leadership."\n  The maids scamper away after their done and [dw_prison_host.GetFirstName] comes forward and grasps my cock, giving it a squeeze. She lectures me about how the seed of rulers isn't meant for commoners, and how its such poor decisions like that which lead to the decline of dynasties. The whole time, she's squeezing and stroking my cock.\n  "Since you've a clear disregard for the responsibility your seed carries, I shall take it on myself."\n  [dw_prison_host.GetFirstName] then disrobes before me. Her two guards doing their best to not look at her naked form. She turns, and guides my cock into her warm pussy. My head swims as it tries to process what is going on, I'm supposed to be her prisoner, and here she's slapping her body back on mine with such force that I'm going to be emptying my balls inside of her.\n  I cum hard inside of her, but she doesn't stop her pumping her hips against me. At least not until she shudders from her own orgasm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents215a;I've been raped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents215b;I think I'm alright with this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents220.0;I'm stripped of my clothes by [dw_prison_host.GetFirstName]'s guards. Their hands are rough, and they take every opportunity to explore my body as they peel off my clothing. [dw_prison_host.GetFirstName] watches the entire time, and even occasionally gives direction to pinch or rub different regions of my body.\n  An iron collar is then placed around my neck, with a chain attached to it. I'm forced down to all fours, and [dw_prison_host.GetFirstName] then takes me for a walk around the dungeon. Finally, she leads me to a corner, where she has a throne of sorts set-up. She disrobes and sits upon the throne.\n  "Come now [ROOT.GetFirstName], be a good little whore and service your Queen."\n  I consider trying to resist, but a guard puts his boot against my ass and gives me a small push forward. I'm eye level with [dw_prison_host.GetFirstName]'s pussy.\n  The chain on my collar is jerked, and I'm pulled forward. I resign to my fate and let my tongue flick out, licking one of the folds of her pussy.\n  "Come now, you're a woman yourself. You should know what feels good. Get at it or I'll give you to every guardsman I have."\n  I close my eyes and commit myself to the task. I employ the use of one of my hands, first to give clear access to her clit, and then to slide into her pussy where I seek her pleasure spots. When she finally peaks she yanks on my chain, choking me as she climaxes. She then pets me, and walks me back to my cell where she leaves me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents220a;I've been raped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents220b;I think I'm alright with this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents225.0;I'm stripped of my clothes by [dw_prison_host.GetFirstName]'s guards. Their hands are rough, and they take every opportunity to explore my body as they peel off my clothing. [dw_prison_host.GetFirstName] watches the entire time, and even occasionally gives direction to pinch or rub different regions of my body.\n  When they're done, I notice that [dw_prison_host.GetFirstName] has disrobed and is stroking his cock. I go to take a step back, only to be pushed forward by a guardsman.\n  "Come now [ROOT.GetFirstName], you can accept my royal scepter or I can share you with everyone here in the castle."\n  I freeze as a guardsman behind me chuckles and asks that I continue to resist. [dw_prison_host.GetFirstName] grabs my arm and pulls me over. He takes one of my breasts into his hands and kneads the flesh, ending with pinching a nipple hard. I let out a little yelp and he laughs.\n  Spinning me around, he forces his fingers up into me. There is something on them, and oil, and he pistons them quickly. It burns a little, but I don't have time to complain as he withdraws his fingers and replaces them with his cock.\n  Our coupling has nothing romantic about it. I'm little more than flesh as he fucks me hard, grunting as he's rutting.\n  I'm not certain how long it lasts, but soon I feel something warm fill me as he grunts and holds himself deep inside me. He compliments my behavior and they leave me alone in my cell, filled with his seed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents225a;I've been raped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents225b;I think I'm alright with this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents230;I stop by the cell of [dw_prisoner_target.GetBestName]. They fidget, clearly nervous to why I'm visiting the dungeons. I stand there for a bit, taking a measure of pleasure from watching them squirm.\n  When they finally manage to ask why I'm there, I give them my most sincere smile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents230a;I shall have my way with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents230b;You'll fuck a hyena.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents230end;I've changed my mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents240.0;I instruct my guards to disrobe [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName] and place a collar with chain around her neck. Once prepared, I have her get on all fours, and I take her for a walk around the dungeon.\n  As her pride wears down, I pat her on the head and tell her what a good pet she is. Tears whelm up in her eyes and I can't fully stifle a laugh.\n  I hook her chain on a peg while I disrobe myself. I rub my breasts in the cool dungeon air and find my nipples are standing erect from the sensation. I take my pet's chain and after having a seat, I pull her before me.\n  I explain that our play time is not yet over. She's to service me, as it's only properly for her to acknowledge my generosity as her host. I then lean forward and make it clear that if her appreciation is inadequate, that she'll be bound and left for the guards to fuck until she breaks.\n  Her eyes tell me she understands, and I lean back and spread my legs. [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName] inches forward and gingerly laps at my folds. I give her chain a yank, and stress that I'd prefer she be more like a person starved, than one who's had their full.\n  She nods and then digs in. Her work starts clumsy, yet it improves as she begins to notice what elicits a moan or gasp from me. It isn't long before she's nuzzled in, twirling her tongue around, moving between my cunny and my clit. When she brings her fingers to bear, it's only minutes later that I've locked my legs around her head as I orgasm hard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents240a;Your service was appreciated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents245.0;I instruct my guards to disrobe [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName]. She does her best to resist, and with a nod of my approval, one of the guards gives her punch to the stomach. The fight quickly subsides and once disrobed, the guards leave her naked on the ground.\n  I take my clothes off as well, and as I walk around her huddled form, I stroke my cock with excitement. I grab the flask of oil that I brought with me and pour some into my hand. I pull [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName] to her feet and from behind, I reach up between her legs and rub the oil across her pussy. Taking the time to also insert a couple fingers to lubricate her, as I've no desire for a dry fuck.\n  With her properly oiled, I take my position and slid my pole in to the hilt. She gasps and whimpers, while her pussy seems to clamp down on me. Just what I was wanting to feel.\n  I pick up my pace, fucking her without a care in the world. I've one primary objective, and that's to empty my balls. It isn't too long before I feel my balls tighten, as they prepare to blow. I notice that [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName] is largely quiet, save for small grunts as I pound home. I wouldn't be surprised if the bitch was starting to like it. With that thought, I feel my cock is ready to erupt. The only question is where.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents245a;I'll fill her with my seed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents245b;I'll pull out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents250.0;I instruct my guards to disrobe and bind [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName]'s hands to the ceiling manacles. Once he's naked and bound, I motion for them to give us privacy.\n  I walk around [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName], making comments about his body while occasionally tracing my finger along his skin. I begin to disrobe myself and I laugh as I see his cock jerk and stiffen. I taunt him as I walk around him, moving to where my breast brush his back. I trace my fingers under his balls, and his cock is now rigid.\n  I can feel my juices flowing, and I'm ready for release. Before I begin though, I grab his balls and threaten him. If he goes limp before I achieve release, he will be castrated.\n  He stammers something unimportant, as I turn and raise my ass towards him. I reach between my legs, feeling for his cock, and upon finding it, I align it and then push my body back onto it.\n  I moan as it slides in. It's just what I need to scratch my present itch. I begin slamming my ass back with a growing frenzy as the sensation in me builds. [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName] isn't able to do much more than grunt and accept my pussy as it takes his cock. I shiver with the joy of control, as I feel his cock seem to swell. I pick up the pace, as I work to bring myself to a climax. I feel him cum, filling me with his warm seed.\n  Lucky for him, I climax myself just moments later. Panting as it comes over me, I slam back and hold it until the sensation passes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents250.1;I instruct my guards to disrobe and bind [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName]'s hands to the wall manacles. Once he's naked and bound, I motion for them to give us privacy.\n  I pull out a leather whip that I had made for just such an occasion. I give it a little crack to make it clear that disobedience will be met with pain. [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName] nods in understanding. I then remove my footwear, and with my bare feet, I flip up his cock. It gives a little jerk from the attention and his cheeks redden. I admonish him for getting turned on in such a state, with his dick getting harder as I manipulate it with my feet.\n  He seems to finally get upset, and flails his leg in a failed kick attempt. I can't help but laugh as I bring my whip down upon him. Snap. Snap. Snap.\n  With bloody lines streaked across his chest, his fight is gone, yet his cock is still rigid. I remove my dress, and stand to straddle him. I lower myself on him, taking his cock into me. He moans, and laugh. What a pitiful man to be raped by a woman.\n  I bounce on his cock as I seek release. I find myself lost in the sensation, until I begin to tremble from the climax that washes over me. Sated, I begin to lift myself off of him, only to notice that he came at some point during the ordeal as his cum drips from my pussy. I chuckle, and give his balls another little nudge with my foot before leaving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents250a;Your obedience and seed are appreciated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents255.0;I instruct my guards to disrobe and bind [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName]'s arms. Once complete, my guards exit the cell, and I then disrobe myself. Once naked, I take some oil and begin to stroke my cock with it, making it nice and slick. While doing this, I explain to [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName] how I'm going to fuck them like the whore they are and fill them with my seed. [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName] begs for me to change my mind, and all that it does is make me laugh, making the act all the more savory.\n  I lay behind [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName] and line up my cock. With some pressure, I slide it in. His tight ass resisting and tightening. It takes a bit, but soon I'm balls deep in his tight ass, and I begin pounding.\n  His whimpering and shrieks of pain become a little annoying, so I choke him a bit, just enough to force him to focus on breathing instead of shouting.\n  I can almost smell his fear, and I pound him all the harder for it. I also chuckle as his cock responds, stiffening some and leaking pre-cum. But I'm not here to please him, and I focus once more on my pleasure. Soon, I feel my balls tighten, and I know release is coming.\n  I growl as my climax comes, and I give several pronounced thrusts into his ass, each one dropping a load of my seed into his ass.\n  Once done, I dress and leave him laying there, whimpering on the cell floor with my seed in his ass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents255.1;I instruct my guards to disrobe and bind [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName]'s limbs. Once complete, my guards exit the cell, and I then disrobe myself. Once naked, I take some oil and begin to stroke my cock with it, making it nice and slick. While doing this, I explain to [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName] how I'm going to fuck them like the whore they are and fill them with my seed. [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName]'s muffled cries make me laugh, making the act all the more savory.\n  I sit down and pull [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName] on top of me. After rubbing some oil on his ass, I line up my cock and let his weight slide his body down my pole. Based on his muffled sounds, I'm sure it was a little uncomfortable. Once settled, I begin to bounce him on my lap, enjoying how tight his ass is. The motion causes his dick to flop, and soon, it's standing rigid. But I'm not here to please him, so I pull a nail from a leather sheath, apply some oil, and I slide it down his urethra. It's clearly painful and uncomfortable, but man does his ass tighten in response.\n  With his fuck hole nice and tight, I resume bouncing him, until I feel my balls tighten with my pending climax.\n  I growl as I cum, and I give several pronounced thrusts into his ass, each one depositing a load of my seed into his ass.\n  Once done, I dress and leave him laying there, whimpering on the cell floor with my seed in his ass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents255.2;I instruct my guards to disrobe and suspend [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName] in chains. Once complete, my guards move back and line up against the wall.\n  I take some oil and begin to rub his cock with it and balls with it. It's a special oil that stimulates the flesh, and soon his cock is standing at attention.\n  I take the time to tease him for getting hard in front of all of the men in the room, and his cheeks burn red with shame. I accuse him of wanting to cum in front of us, and he vehemently denies it. I give his cock a little slap, and the pre-cum that was forming at the tip flies out and lands on his chest. I debase him, accusing him of wishing to be fucked.\n  While he's denying it, I pour more of the oil on my fingers and then begin to rub them around his sphincter. He gasps and struggles a bit, but I point out that his cock only seems that much stiffer, and more pre-cum has appeared.\n  Before he can object further, I slip a couple well oiled fingers into his ass, and with a little pressure, he's soon gasping and twitching as his cum shoots all over his chest.\n  Not giving him rest, I continue my assault and he's soon rigid and oozing pre-cum again. He's no longer objecting, just panting, which I take pleasure in pointing out.\n  After he cums a second time, I leave him with his drying cum splattered across his chest, and his confused thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents255a;Perhaps I'll visit you again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents260;I've made arrangements with Harley to borrow one of her hyenas. Harley's only requirement of course would be that she can watch.\n  [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName] began crying as the guards stripped her and bound her in chains. When Harley and the hyena she chose to bring along showed up, [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName] began to wail and beg. Harley gave out a laugh and lifted the prisoner's manacled legs. The hyena nuzzled her pussy for a bit, sniffing around before it began to lick her sex in earnest. [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName] yelped in surprise, and Harley made sure to mention that it was important she not struggle much, otherwise her hyena may injure her as it seeks to secure it's mating.\n  [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName] listened to Harley and nodded in understanding. Surprising like always, Harley quieted the woman with ease.\n  The hyena meanwhile seemed satisfied and crawled forward atop of the prisoner. It's hips were moving on the way up, as though it was searching blindly for it's cock to find its target. Harley bend over with a chuckle, and helped guide the hyena's cock home into [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName]'s pussy. Once in, it's hips began moving furiously.\n  There [dw_prisoner_target.GetFirstName] was, in the middle of the dungeon, with others watching her, and she was getting drilled by a hyena. Her face was crimson with embarrassment, especially when the hyena finally erupted and filled her with its cum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents260a;Let this be a lesson.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dw_hvevents1010;On my way to the lair, I spot the Vulture off in the distance. Curious, I head over to towards him.\n  When I arrive, I find him muttering to himself while adjusting straps on what looks to be a new outfit rig. I clear my throat to get his attention, only to find he's so engrossed in what he's doing that he still doesn't notice me. I feel my jaw tighten at the annoyance of being ignored, so I call out 'Adrian!'\n  The Vulture turns and hisses at his name. His distaste for it clear. It's then that he finally notices me.\n  "Ah, [ROOT.GetMasterMistress] [ROOT.GetOnlyDynastyName], I didn't notice your arrival."\n  I wave off the obvious, and inquire as to what the Vulture is doing.\n  "I've been struck by a bit'o inspiration. This is just a prototype that I've cobbled together, yet I'm certain that I can clearly improve my gear. I just need to keep working on it. In fact, if I just..."\n  I stand there and observe the Vulture for a bit longer as he becomes absorbed once more in his work. I don't recall the last time I've seen him like this, and I know that if our roles were reversed, that I wouldn't wise to be bothered.\n  So I leave the Vulture to his inspiration and continue on my way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1010a;Such inspiration is good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1020;I come across the Vulture perched atop a rock. He looks livid as a vein bulges on his head. Getting a little closer, I notice that his outfit is a little worse for wear. So I ask about his problems.\n  The Vulture glares at me for a moment, before seeming to recognize me. Then without a word, he loosens his hand a red mask with what appears to be web stitching falls out. Holding it out, he finally speaks.\n  "I've encountered a so called 'hero'. One who goes by the name of Spiderman. He thwarted my attempt at obtaining a jewel I was after. My target escaped while we fought. In the end, this... Spiderman escaped as well. I will not tolerate this."\n  Troublesome to know that some hero is taking action nearby. The Vulture believes he's from a near by land. Regardless, Spiderman obtained a new rival today, whether he realizes the animosity the Vulture has for him or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1020a;A new rival for the Vulture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1030;One thing that irks me about heroes is how self righteous they can be. I rule my people. My country operates through laws that I've a hand in implementing.\n  Yet you still have these self proclaimed heroes who somehow take issue with what I do. And then you've the really foolish ones, like Batgirl here, who feel justified in assaulting me within my own realm. Unfortunately for her, I'm more capable than she imagined.\n  I squat down, looking at the blood flowing out from between her fingers, her fear clearly in her eyes as she looks at my blade. I smile, and ask what she hoped to accomplish.\n  "You're a monster. The people will be freed from your tyranny. If not by my hand, it'll be by someone else."\n  Typical. Sure, some of my decisions are met with more distaste than others, but even the legendary King Arthur had people who disagreed with some of his actions. It just comes with the job of being a ruler.\n  Anyway, it's pointless to try and get that through her head at the moment. So I stand, let out a sigh, and ponder what to do with Batgirl now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1030a;Leave her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1030b;Finish her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1030c;Imprison her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1040;I'm relaxing when Harley comes wandering in. As normal, her attire has changed once again. This time she's adorned with a variety of gadgets, as well as an interesting looking monocle eye patch.\n  "Hey boss [ROOT.GetGirlWomanBoyMan]. What'cha think o' my new look?"\n  I give her my opinion, and then ask what the gadgets do. Motioning towards the smoking gadget on her wrist as I ask.\n  "Oh this stuff? It's fer show mostly. Wrist has a little bowl with an ember and some tobacco. It don't do anything other than look cool. Am I right? This thing is da real deal tho."\n  She taps her monocle eye patch.\n  "It like lets me zoom in and see stuff. I just gotta turn it here, like this. It's been helpful already, bein' decent at reading lips an' all."\n  Interesting. Some definite value with that. Of course, I'll now need to cover my mouth if I'm sharing something I don't want Harley to learn about, but I suppose the trade off is worth it. As a more proficient Harley Quinn can only further benefit me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1040a;Good to hear Harley.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1050h;I'm relaxing in the lounge, having just finished seeing one of my lovers, when Harley walks into the room. Seeing me, she dashes over and I prepare for to receive her affection.\n  She shrieks out her customary cry of 'Puddin' as she bounds over, full of her normal energy, which leaves me wondering if I'll be able to handle her so soon after the visit from my prior lover.\n  As she stops short, my concerns leave my head, as in one quick motion, she slams me across the head with her club. My vision threatens to fade out, as I try to get an arm up to defend myself.\n  "Puddin! You've been a bad [ROOT.GetGirlWomanBoyMan]."\n  The club comes down again, bursting past my weakened defense.\n  "I never said I had to be your only one, and the occasional shag partner is alright, but to have so many regular lovers. I just feel like you're not appreciatin' me like ya should."\n  I fumble to get words out to defuse her assault, but she slams the club into my side and I sprawl across the floor.\n  "I came ta you, even wit cha bein' a hero. I thought ya'd treat me better.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dw_hvevents1050a;This is going to hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1050b;I compel you to stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1051;I try to defend myself. To get Harley away from me. Her attack is viscous, and I'm too shaken to properly recover.\n  WHACK!\n  "Hahaha. It hurts lover. Can ya feel my pain inside?"\n  WHACK!\n  I curl into a fetal position and do my best to cover my head. I'm barely holding onto consciousness. Where are my guards?\n  WHACK!\n  "Whew. I think I feel betta finally. Thanks fer lettin' me get that off my chest."\n  Sure enough the assault seems to have stopped. I relax, and groan from the throbbing pain.\n  "Well, I suppose we're splitsville. At least fer now. Maybe look me up in da future if ya decide to do right by me.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1051a;That's going to leave a mark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1052;Harley's eyes seem to glaze over as she stops mid-swing. I pull myself up and check quick to ensure that I've no serious damage.\n  I should be alright, but any more and I would have been injured, if not killed by this psycho bitch. So, she's alright with me screwing around, but she wants me to keep the number of my regular relationships to a minimum? Bah, trying to figure out how her mind works isn't worth the headache.\n  As it is, I've some simple choices. Do I send her away and forget about this little outburst. Or I can break up with her before sending her off, to not risk a repeat. I could also break her mind further than it already is. If anything, she should worship me so much that she'd never consider doing such a thing again. Or perhaps I'll just have her march herself down to the dungeon for a bit, so she can cool off behind bars for a bit.\n  Decisions, decisions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1052a;Get out Harley.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1052b;We're no longer lovers you psycho.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1052c;You shall be obedient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1052d;Off to the dungeon with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1060f;I'm wrapping up some paperwork when Harley comes sliding into the room. She's looking a little more mischievous than normal, certainly some kind of new idea she's got.\n  "Hey boss [ROOT.GetGirlWomanBoyMan]. Do you like me?"\n  I'm a little surprised by the question. I begin considering what exactly she means by her question when she helps clarify.\n  "Come on boss [ROOT.GetGirlWomanBoyMan]. It's not that hard. Am I someone you'd like to snuggle wit'? Not in like the friends wit' benefits sort o' way. I'm talkin' about somethin' deep. Like I look in yuir eyes, ya look in mine. Ya know, lovers."\n  I sit back and take a good look at Harley. She's fidgeting a bit. Her normally boundless energy carrying a clear nervous edge to it.\n  "And I know dat some would see it as weird, us both bein' chicks an all, but dat don't bother me. If it got too bad, I'd just take ma club to em anyhow."\n  Harley's question aside, there are those that would view our being lovers with distain should it get out. Not that it would influence my answer anyway.\n  I meet Harley's gaze and give her my reply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dw_hvevents1060c;Don't bring this up with me again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1070;I had the most enlightening dream. In it, my mind's eye awoke, and I my world changed.\n  With concentration I could hear the thoughts of another. By exerting the right kind of pressure, I could steer a person's desire towards sharing the truth, rather than their intended lie. At the height of my dream, I could even exert my will over another to where their mind's defense broke down, leaving them obedient.\n  When I woke, I could still see it all so vividly, to include the meditative techniques I used to fully awaken my mind's eye. I scrambled for paper and quill, with the intention of recording the thoughts. It was then, as I stared at the paper, that I realized it was unnecessary. It was as if the knowledge was already etched into my psyche. All that would be necessary would be devoting the necessary time over the coming months to fully unlocking it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1070a;Let the meditation begin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1070b;This isn't for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1071;I let out a sigh as my meditation ends. It's finally complete. I can feel it. My mind's eye is open.\n  I walk out of my room and stop to consider the guard before me. My mind reaches out, searching. I hear his thoughts, his questioning of what my bidding shall be, and whether or not he'll be chastised by the captain of the guard should me desire have him leave his post. I smile at him, and simply wish him a good morning.\n  I stop by the kitchen, surprising the staff working there. I reach out my mind to observe the cook and ask him questions. I see his wariness, seeking to answer as careful and with as little information as possible, in an attempt to not draw my ire during this unexpected visit. I put some pressure on him with my mind and soon his responses are more blunt, and detailed. A serving maid gasps at the cook's apparent breach of etiquette. I chuckle and leave the kitchen.\n  My efforts have proven to be successful. Now that the work is done, my time can be spent trying to devise useful methods of employing my new found abilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1071a;My mind has awoken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1080;"Hey boss [Root.GetGirlWomanBoyMan]! Look at what I got from a merchant. These sweeties was sad and tied up. Dangerous he said. But they're sweeties I tell ya. Just look at 'em."\n  I turn to find Harley flanked by a pair of full grown hyenas. Harley's scratching behind ears and patting bellies, while they're eating up her attention. I step a little closer, and one rolls over from its back and lets out a low growl in warning.\n  "Ah, come on now boys. Da boss is alright. [Root.GetSheHeCap] treats your Harley good. So no's growling."\n  I watch as the hyenas turn to look at Harley as she speaks, as though they understand her. They then both turn back to me, and while something tells me they're not fully on board with her direction yet, at least neither one is growling any more. I wonder if Harley's one of those animal whisperers that I hear the peasants talk about on occasion.\n  "Any ways, I just wanted ya ta meet 'em. They're sweet cuties, but I thinks they'll be helpful to on jobs, cause they's smart. Not like you boss, but then ya know that."\n  I watch as Harley then mentions that it's time for some chow, and the beasts seem to respond once again as though they understand. As they walk away, I imagine things might get interesting on occasion with them around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1080a;Alright Harley.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1080b;Alright Harley. (Yes beastiality);;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1080c;Alright Harley. (No beastiality);;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1090;I'm enjoying the evening air when I notice a bright light streaking across the sky. A rare falling star. I understand the peasantry claim that it's desirable to wish upon them. I've also seen other texts written to indicate that high quality iron can sometimes be found should such a site impact the Earth.\n The light seems to flash a bit brighter, and I hear a resonating boom echo through the night air. Sure enough, the streak of light disappears just beyond a copse of trees.\n  I stand there for a moment, in awe of what I just saw. While I've viewed wishing upon a star to be nothing more than superstition, I've often wondered about the ore that some have claimed to found from such an occurrence. The impact site I believe is just a few miles away at most. It's night, but I could grab my horse and head out there to investigate it. Or, it might be safer to just go to bed having appreciated witnessing a rare spectacle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1090a;I'll go check it out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1090b;I think I'll pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1091;With it being night time, locating the impact site takes a little longer than normal. I'm also no longer alone as I came across one of my guard patrols that was investigating it as well.\n  We've spread out, lanterns held high as we scan the area. That's when one of the guards yells out that they've found something, which is soon followed by his frantic screams.\n  Weapons are drawn and we converge on the sound of the screaming guardsman.  We find a rather horrific site. At first it looks like the guard has had some kind of thick black liquid tossed upon him, akin to tar. But then as we close, we see it moves, and it's invasive. Moving around him, sliding into his mouth, his ears, his eyes. It's also dissolving or shedding his clothing, leaving tattered strips of cloth, leather and metal on the ground. His shouts soon turn to little more than gargling noises. The guardsmen look towards me and I hold my hand up for them to hold fast.\n  I survey the area further, and notice a small crater, the impact site most likely. There is a spherical rock that appears to have split, and I can see the remaining ichor flow from it, up onto, and into the unfortunate guardsman who's now on his knees and convulsing. Seeing no other impact sites, I feel comfortable that we're facing just the one.\n  Turning back to it, we're taken for another surprise, as the ichor covered guardsman forms some words, with a deep guttural voice that doesn't appear to be the guardsman's. "Where am I are we?";;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1091a;Communicate with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1091b;Burn it. Burn it now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1092;I step forward and address the creature that is taking shape from as the black liquid seems to now completely cover my former guardsman. I make it aware that it is in my lands, and that it needs to give me a reason to not have it killed right here and now.\n  The creature chuckles, a deep resonating sound that seems to unsettle a few of the guardsmen, until I step forward again and raise my voice, commanding it to answer or perish. The confidence in my voice is contagious, and those guardsmen who took a step back, recover their determination. This isn't lost on the being as it takes in its surroundings.\n  "I/we are Venom. This body, Eddie, is my/our host. Kill me/us, kill him."\n  I shrug off its feeble threat, and then explain how every guardsman has the responsibility to die for me if it were so required. So I explain that unless Venom can give me reason it should be allowed to live, then I'm alright calling upon his host to fulfill his duty. The being seems to consider this.\n  "If you allow me/us to live, I/we shall give you my/our loyalty. I/we are a capable soldier. Allow me/us a home, and I/we shall protect it fiercely. Your enemies shall be my/our enemies."\n  Well, this being, a parasite of some sort, doesn't seem able to give me much beyond their support. It is quite imposing though, and I do like that whole my enemies will be its enemies part. So I guess the only real question then is whether that's enough or not to spare it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1092a;Welcome to my realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1092b;You must die. (Kills Venom);;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1093;I decide that this being isn't worth the risk to my lands, and without a word, I hurl my lantern at it. It hits true, and oil and flame encase the creature. My guardsmen need no prodding, as their lanterns arc through the night sky as well.\n  The creature howls, and flails in an attempt to put itself out. As the flames burn higher, the black liquid that had begun to solidify around my guardsman begins to liquify again. For a moment, I fear I may have underestimated the creature, until I can clearly see the strands turning into smoke from the heat. Burning away.\n  The beast howls and curses me, seeming to decide that it wishes to take my life. I see it extend an arm out towards me, as if to reach me, but the flames dancing upon it appear to have burned so much that the black ichor like substance is barely covering the burning, peeling flesh of my guardsman. It's unnatural maw snaps at me, yet even part of the jaw of the creature is beginning to sag and melt away. They guardsman's body stumbles and falls flat, unable to get free of the oil and flames. We all watch in silence until all that's left is a smoldering burnt corpse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1093a;You were not meant for this world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1100;I'm enjoying the evening stars when I notice a brilliant emerald flash appear nearby. As I arrive to see what caused such a phenomenon, I find the ground charred and smoking. In the center is a woman, with what appear to be tentacles instead of hair, ears pointed like an elf, and green clothing with heraldry that I've never seen before.\n  I steady myself and call for the woman to identify herself. She looks towards me, her eyes a greenish-yellow. She seems to study me for several moments, and I brace myself for potential hostility.\n  "Apologies. I sought a land to die upon. I knew not that this was inhabited. I am Two Six Seven Nine Four One Six. Worry not, I shall expire soon."\n  I decide to call her Two-Six. My curiosity peaked, I inquire why she seeks to die.\n  "My planet perished. I failed to save it from the darkness. I used the remaining power in my arcane ring to flee, with the intention of dying on another world, where my body wouldn't be lost to the darkness."\n  I ask if she's wounded, and learn that without a reason to go on, that she will simply will herself to expire. I ask about the darkness, and she doesn't know much other than it came from the stars, corrupting and consuming those on her planet. She was a warrior of the light, blessed with an arcane ring, which is now cracked and crumbling. It was her weapon and her shield against the darkness.\n  If her life's purpose is lost, perhaps having her join me will give her reason to live. Of course, her appearance will certainly bother some.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1100a;Consider this your home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1100b;This world is not for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1110;I'm visiting an inn after a hunt with some other nobles. It was agreed that a round of drinks would be welcome before heading back.\n  We've not been in here long, but there is a smell that seems off. I recall the scent, and rumors of past assassination attempts that involved explosions during seemingly innocent stops. I call out for everyone to evacuate. Those who know me best waste no time leaving, while others pause for a moment as I motion for them to leave. I grab a waitress and push her towards the door, yelling once again for everyone to get out of the building.\n  My warning was just in time, for when the room shudders from an explosion that seems to have originated from beneath the floorboards. The room is awash with fire, and I grab a cook who was stumbling out from the kitchen and shove him out through a window. I hear a creek right above me, and look up to see a portion of the roof break away above me. I put myself against the wall and brace for the impact.\n  I manage to avoid any major damage, but I'm clearly trapped. I push against it and while it shifts some. I brace myself and put my back into it, and it shifts a bit more, and then suddenly, it moves with ease. I look over to see a woman had helped me. She's a sight to behold, she's clearly strong, with muscles clearly visible. She turn towards me to recommend we leave, and I notice her white shirt has a noticeable gap in its fabric.\n  Once outside, I find out her name is Kara, and that she's been a wandering noble without a home after hers was destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1110a;Consider my realm your new home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1110b;Good luck on your travels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1120;I'm out for a ride when I hear a loud boom, followed by smoke rising in the distance. I spur my horse towards it to investigate.\n  As I get closer, I hear shouting, shrieking, and... laughter? I arrive to find an unexpected sight. I find Power Girl holding a female jester by her cloak. And there is something on Kara's back. Horns, hooves, is that a Satyr on her back? Kara's not looking very happy, while the jester she's holding looks... delighted I guess? I ask Power Girl if everything is alright.\n  "[ROOT.GetFirstName], I..."\n  Kara is cut off by the jester shrieking in delight.\n  "No way! You're da boss [ROOT.GetGirlWomanBoyMan] around here? Your lands are a little stiff, how about's cha let little ole Harley settle down 'ere? I'm harmless, totally and honest, fer sure."\n  Power Girl gives Harley's cloak a little shake, which causes the young woman to spin around and cackle with glee.\n  "[ROOT.GetFirstName], she's hardly..."\n  "I'm Harley."\n  I half expect Kara to punch the little imp, but she seems to compose herself. "[ROOT.GetFirstName], she's the cause of what you see. I thought she looked suspicious, and I'm pretty certain this was a trap for me."\n  "Ah geez, I was just trying to help out Herman. Ya now, setting the mood and all, didn't expect it to go BOOM."\n  I guess that Herman is the Satyr, and I inquire as to why it's still on her back. Kara manages to glower even more as Harley begins laughing again.\n  "She's gotta get it off... Get it? Hahahahahaha."\n  "*sigh* What do you want me to do with her?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1120a;You can hang here Harley;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1120b;Leave my lands now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1120c;To prison with her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1125;I'm out for a ride when I hear a loud boom, followed by smoke rising in the distance. I spur my horse towards it to investigate.\n  As I get closer I hear shouting, shrieking, and... laughter? I arrive to find an unexpected sight. I find a muscular woman with revealing clothing, holding Harley by her cloak, and there is something on the woman's back. Horns, hooves, is it a Satyr? The woman is not looking very happy, while Harley looks delighted. I ask Harley if everything is alright.\n  "Hey! Boss [ROOT.GetGirlWomanBoyMan], can we keep 'er? She's so pretty and strong."\n  The woman's gaze softens a bit as she looks me over.\n  "I'm Kara, is this, this jester yours?"\n  Kara holds Harley out towards me, the movement causing Harley to spin. This results in Harley laughing gleefully, she's clearly enjoying herself. I acknowledge Harley as one of my subjects. Kara realizes my position and lowers Harley to the ground.\n  "My apologies. I didn't know I was speaking with the ruler of these lands. Your, your subject... She ambushed me."\n  Harley starts dancing around Kara a tune. I see Harley's in one of her moods, I begin to question them to get an idea of what took place.\n Turns out Harley heard of Kara, she's apparently a wandering noble hero who's nickname is Power Girl due to her strength. She arranged a little prank that Kara fell for, with the result now being that Kara has a Satyr on her back that she needs to get off, literally.\n  "She ain't got no home boss [ROOT.GetGirlWomanBoyMan], can't we keep her?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1125a;You can live here Kara;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1125b;Leave my lands now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1125c;To prison with her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1130;It's late and I've decided to get a snack. I'm heading towards the kitchen, when I hear a commotion down the hallway. It's coming from a door which is ajar.\n  I make my way down there and am surprised to find Kara on her knees in front of several staff members. Speaking of members, she is working all three of them.\n  She's stroking one in each hand, while allowing another to slide it's girth between her ample breasts. She's also taking rotations with her mouth, giving each one teasing licks, while taking one occasionally into her mouth for a brief period.\n  I knew that Kara had become quite lustful, yet I'm still surprised. If the door was closed, I'd not be standing here now witnessing this.\n  As I stand there, one of the servants reaches his limits and shoots a stream of thick jizz across her face. She smiles and licks the tip of the cock. The one between her breasts seems to have reached their limit, as they fire a shot straight into her open mouth. The third man begins erupting before the third is done with his pulsing streams.\n  Soon, Kara is covered with their semen, and with a smile, she asks if they've got another load in them to share. It's at that time, that she notices me standing in the doorway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1130a;Chastise her behavior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1130b;Let her have her fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1130c;Your Silence for a favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1130d;I think I'll join too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1140;I've noticed it for a couple weeks, that Kara doesn't seem to be getting as upset with Harley as she was in the past. And while Harley's still filled with too much energy, she's drastically scaled back on her embarrassing pranks towards Kara.\n  After a day at court, when most of the people have filtered out, I notice the two talking about grabbing something to eat at the inn in town. I make my way over to them, and comment on how friendly they've become.\n  Harley yelps like she's seen a mouse, and hops onto Kara's back. She then goes into a laugh, that sounds more nervous than maniacal.\n  "Ah, yea, haha. We're not friendly, an' we ain't talkin' 'bout dinner. We's uh, a duel. Yeah."\n  Kara let's out a sigh, tries once to peel Harley off of her back, and then just leaves her hanging there.\n  "So, Harley isn't that bad. And yeah, I'd say we're being friendly. I know, a hero and a villain, it's supposed to be like dogs and cats."\n  "I like kitties n' puppies."\n  "*sigh* Yeah, anyway, if we're friends, it's not a problem, is it? I mean, would you rather we be tearing up the place constantly?"\n  "Ah, Pee Gee, ya really see me as a friend?"\n  Harley gives Kara a hug, until she seems to realize that I'm still there. Her eyes pop open, and she looks at me a little nervous. I wave them off and wish them well with their dinner tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1140a;Interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1150;I'm traveling through the country side when I notice that the fields look more robust than normal. I comment on it to one of the laborers working the field, and they share that it'll be a good harvest due to the nymph's blessing. Curious, I direct the peasant to share all he knows of the nymph.\n  It apparently resides in the nearby woods, and while none of seen her up close, many have seen her briefly from a distance. I decide to look into it, and while riding through the woods, I hear a familiar voice call out to me. Looking up, I notice Poison Ivy up in a tree, where she's stroking some vines as if they were loved pets. Of course, it's clear now the source of the peasants 'wood nymph.'\n  I commend her on the state of the fields, and she shrugs, sharing that she didn't purposefully encourage the vegetation there to grow. That if anything, it's simply a side effect of the time she's spent recently communing with nature.\n  I take the opportunity to inquire about her rather unique ability to inspire vegetation. She laughs it off, and asks if I'd believe that she's the child of a human and a forest spirit.\n  I try to read her expression, seeking insight as to if she's joking or not. Unable to clearly tell, I ask if she's serious. She gives a light hearted laugh, and then a simple shrug. "Perhaps. Or perhaps it's just a young girl's fanciful dream as to why she is what she is?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1150a;An unexpected bounty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1160;I'm stopping by the armor to pass some time and look over their stock. When I get there, I see Natasha being assisted by the armor.\n  She notices me watching, and once the armor is done, she asks for my opinion. It's definitely different from the normal black cloth and leather outfit she normally wears. It looks like it'll provide her some more protection, but there's something different about it still.\n  The armor seems to notice this and motions for Natasha to stand over in a shadowy corner of the room. She moves there, and I see the difference clearly. The design seems to do a much better job than her normal garb in blending in with the shadows.\n  I inquire about it with the armor, and he shares that Natasha has worked with him on it for the past several months, trying out different approaches. They found that while her normal garb works well in concealment from a distance, up close, it's largely uniform shape seemed to draw attention to it, as though it was too uniform to blend in properly when viewed up close. While by breaking up the design, with smaller patterns and layers, seemed to make it harder to see it in closer quarters.\n  Natasha nods in agreement with the armor's explanation. "The perfect garb for infiltration or assassination."\n  I nod in understanding, and then make the mental note to stay on Natasha's good side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1160a;Your prowess is impressive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1170;I stop by the training yard to do a little workout, and find Red Robin is already there. I've heard he's been coming here a lot more than normal lately.\n  He's working over a training dummy with a variety of moves, but something seems a little off. As I move to an area for my own warm-up, Tim stops mid-swing and tilts his head towards me. I then notice that his eyes are covered. That explains what was off about his strikes, they weren't quite as crisp as normal, yet they far exceeded what I'd expect from someone who couldn't see their target.\n  I ask him if he's been wounded. Recognizing my voice he greets me.\n  "Good day [ROOT.GetFirstName]. I'm fine. This (he taps his eye covering), is something I thought of in order to try and improve myself. I was in a recent bout, and some dirt got into my eyes. The tide turned almost immediately, and I'd like to minimize such an impact from happening again. I don't suppose you'd be willing to do a little sparring with me?"\n  I oblige, and we have an extremely good session. Tim struggles more than normal against me, yet at the same time, it's much better than I'd expect for a person who was robbed of their sight.\n  When we're done, he shares that it's helped him a bit even when not wearing the blindfold. As he's learned to be more aware and quicker to react. Although he isn't certain how much longer he'll be able to keep up the intense training, he's happy with the results so far.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1170a;Nice work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1180;I'm heading over to the training yard for a bit of practice, when I hear what sounds like some intense sparring. When I get over there, I see that Gwen and one of my veteran guardsmen are having a sparring session. It's a hotly contested one, until it looks like the guardsman manages to disarm Gwen.\n  With no break in her movement, Gwen steps in, and lands a pair of consecutive punches to the guardsman's exposed chin. He crumples to the ground, and the others who were watching either wince in pain, or applaud in appreciation.\n  I approach them as Gwen is helping up her sparring partner, and I congratulate them both on such a fine bout. Making a point to acknowledge how Gwen seized back the initiative when disarmed with some impressive unarmed strikes.\n  "Thank you [ROOT.GetFirstName]. I've been focusing more on my unarmed combat. I find that weapons don't feel as natural to me, so I want to get where I'm not at a disadvantage without one."\n  The guardsman she sparred against comments that next time he'll refrain from trying to disarm her, as he'd like to avoid those punches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1180a;Keep up the good work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1190;I'm out looking through some vendor's stalls when I hear people talking about a fight, and others moving towards it to watch. I decide to join them myself, since I had no other real plans.\n  When I move to where I can see the fight, I find an impressive sight indeed. The hero known as Spiderman is exchanging blows with Venom. It's a very entertaining exchange, with impressive blows, resilience and determination, and moves that few others can match. On top of that, you've the intimidating threats from Venom, and the almost carefree banter of Spiderman. Giving a stark contrast between them, which only further improves the entertainment.\n  It's also clear that they're pretty evenly matched. And as the fight stretches out, it appears that a draw is becoming likely. All things considered, these are clearly two rivals, and it's typically poor form to interrupt such an exchange. But then again, can I really afford not assisting Venom and potentially allowing Spiderman to walk free?\n\n Note: Interference leads to a male on male scene.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1190a;Let the rivals battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1190b;Interfere and help Venom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1195;I decide to interfere in this tightly fought contest, positioning myself to the back of Spiderman. He somehow seems to now I've moved there, and moves to avoid me. It's too much though, as he's unable to avoid Venom's brutal blow.\n  Spiderman reels, and I lash out seeking to finish him. He spins, mitigating my blow, but once again putting himself on the receiving end of one from Venom. This causes him to collapse, and Venom leaps upon him. He alternates between brutal strikes and shredding slashes.\n  I'm expecting entrails to soon go flying, but instead Venom hisses something about it being time and I see a rather impressive sized cock form. Spiderman seems too out of it to realize what's going to happen, so he puts up no resistance as Venom slams his cock up Spiderman's ass.\n  Spiderman yells out in pain, but his now exposed cock twitches and hardens a bit. Venom's long tongue entwines around Spiderman's dick and begins moving as though giving it a hand job.\n  I take a step back as Venom seems in rapture as he begins drilling Spiderman, grunting things about planting his seed and interested to see if it takes root. Spiderman is whimpering and grunting, his embarrassment clear as Venom's tongue works his cock to a climax. With Venom fucking his ass, Spiderman's streams of cum are splashing all over both of them as it swings free.\n  Finally, Venom bellows out a howl of domination and drops his load in Spiderman's bowels. Pulling out and now standing over Spiderman, he turns and leaves him behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1195a;I leave the defeated alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dw_hvevents1200;Today was disturbed with a commotion about some kind of danger to the realm. There were reports about some... beast that was terrorizing the country side. It had apparently laid waste to a couple farms and a small guard patrol that tried to stop it.\n  I called forth some of my best people, and we rode out to see the threat in person. We rode hard for just over an hour before we arrived at the location of a farm that had been ravaged. A roar in the distance caught our attention and we drove our mounts forward.\n  When we reached the edge of the woods, it was just in time to see a giant of a creature, collapse upon the ground. Harley scampered up on it's back and gave us a little wave. She then skips forward and hops on it's head. Knocking on it's forehead with her first as if to ensure it's really dead.\n  Kara's dusting off herself as she comes around the beast. She gives me a nod before reporting. "The beast is dead my liege. Not certain where it came from exactly, but it shouldn't terrorize anyone again."\n  Harley gives it a couple more knocks on the head. "Ah geez, I think we broke it."\n  Soon, there is a crowd of citizens around. Many who begin to complement the two for saving them by stopping the beast. Others make their way over to me, to thank me for having such notable figures under my leadership.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1200a;Well done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1210;There is a wandering merchant wagon that visits on rare occasions. The merchant has never given himself a proper name, simply preferring to refer to himself as The Collector.\n  It's said that his wares vary depending on the individual visiting his shop, with there always being something for sale within a person's price range. It's said that some lucky individuals may even find rare artifacts for sale.\n  As I approach his cart, he smiles in my direction and gives a little wave of acknowledgement. "I just might have something you'll find interesting. Give me a moment and I'll lay them out for you."\n  The Collector doesn't pull anything out from behind the counter, rather, he walks around the wagon, moving items about until before me are some options that I wonder if I would have found myself had he not exposed them.\n  The collector gives me a small grin as he moves back behind his counter. "As always, all sales are final, and products received are as is.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dw_hvevents1211;I pick up an interesting ceramic plate, which appears to have a young man, curled up in the fetal position in the center, with what appears to be some kind of draconic beast encircling him.\n  "Ah, interesting plate that one. Old Norse tale of a boy who befriended a dragon, breaking his tribe's long standing tradition of hunting them. Boy became a man, ended up leading his tribe, fell in love with a girl. You know, standard fare, save for the whole befriending a dragon bit. It's said he even rode it."\n  I inquire about the name of this young man.\n  "Hiccup. Yes, don't look at me like that. I've no idea why the child's parents hated him so. Anyway, there's more to the legend of course, but the only real important part is that this young man and dragon have no graves, or burial mound. It's said they simply disappeared. Some shaman say that the pair are simply trapped. Imprisoned within an object until one is willing to someday free them."\n  I hold up the plate and ask the obvious question.\n  "That's right. If you believe the old tales, you're holding a prison. Break it, and you may set them free. Or, you could of course just place it on the mantle where it'll be a great conversation piece.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1211a;Keep it as an artifact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1211b;Break the plate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1212;I move to a clearing and snap the ceramic plate in half. A wind kicks up around me, spinning dust and debris into a cloud that has me cover my eyes.\n  As it dies down, I lower my arms and find a young man sitting up and looking around quite confused. I sigh briefly at the absurdity of his supposed name, and call it out. "Hiccup?"\n  The young man's attention turns to me. He struggles to stand, as one may if roused from a long night's slumber. Finally standing and facing me, he asks, "Do I know you?"\n  I explain how we've come to be in the clearing, and how all that I know is based off of the tale of a merchant. I give the year when he asks for it. He doesn't recognize the standard I use for the year. We go back and forth for a while, and it's clear, Hiccup's from an era that far predates the current one.\n  He suddenly begins spinning about and calling out for someone. A 'Toothless.' I ask who he's looking for, and the young man explains that it's the name of the dragon that he befriended. I decide to avoid asking about the odd names they both have and instead search for a portion of the plate that I broke. Finding it, it appears a simple ceramic plate. No traces of the imagery of either the young man or the dragon.\n  Perhaps the reason the young man survived all this time is due to the dragon's sacrifice. Or perhaps it released him elsewhere. Either way, I can either invite Hiccup to remain in my lands while he continues his search, or I can bid him farewell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1212a;You're welcome to stay here Hiccup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1212b;Yes, good luck on your journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1213;I'm a little surprised that the Collector would put a child's doll in front of me. Sure, it seems to be of fine quality, but it's not what I really expect to find being recommended to me. The Collector smiles, as though he senses my thoughts.\n  "It's got quite the history that doll. It's said to be an individual, cursed by some of the foulest magic and trapped as a doll. Others, say it's a blessing, a fair maiden who's love was lost and now she waits as a doll for her beloved to hold her once more. This maiden was supposedly quite the impressive individual. A Shieldmaiden with strength and battle skill comparable to the best of men."\n  As I hold the doll, I have to admit, it feels different than what I'd expect. Almost as though there is a warmth within it. I inquire with the Collector as to which he believes it is, a curse or some blessing that holds the doll.\n  The Collector gives a simple shrug. "It could be neither for all I know. If I were to put some weight into something, it'd be how to free her. A sunlight field, an axe worthy of a warrior, and the blast of a horn to call home a hero."\n  I try to read the eyes of the Collector. He's always difficult to read, and sure enough, he's now flashing that smile that hides all. Well, I could just keep it, or I could try and free her, hopefully not looking the fool while doing so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1213a;Keep it as an artifact;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1213b;Free the maiden;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1214;I follow the Collector's instructions. Standing upon a sun light field, I place the doll of the maiden in the center. I place an axe by its side and I step back and pull out the hunting horn I have. With a deep breath, I blow through the horn, it's deep blast seeming to somehow echo off in the distance.\n  Just as I begin to consider how I'll throttle the Collector for making a fool of me, there is a loud thunderous boom and a flash of light that has me step back and shield my eyes.\n  When my vision returns, I'm no longer alone in the field. A young woman, adorned in clothing similar to that upon the doll is standing there, the axe I laid in her hands. She's wary, looking at me as though uncertain of what she should do.\n  "Who are you... Where am I?"\n  I calmly answer the questions as they come. Her trust in me finally grows enough that she takes a neutral stance. Her questions reach the expected point, how long has she been a doll, are those she once knew still alive. I continue providing answers as best I can. It's clear, that she's from a time period long enough ago, that what little of the world today is familiar to her.\n  She finally gets around to thanking me for freeing her. Although she then expresses concern about what to do next. The answer seems pretty obvious to me, so I speak up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1214a;You've a new home here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1214b;Good luck in your travels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1220;Needing a break from court, I step away with the intent of grabbing some solitude and perhaps a drink. It's then that I hear some odds whines and huffs, like a dog in distress. As I reach the door, I hear giggling and what might be the sounds of a struggle.\n  I open the door expecting to find someone torturing a dog. Instead, I find... I find Harley and her Hyenas. Harley is sandwiched between them, most of her clothing removed. She's atop on of her hyena's and it's swollen member is up her ass. It's hips twitch frantically, yet its position under Harley doesn't give it good purchase. It whines, clearly showing itself to be the sound of distress that I heard.\n  It's brother isn't restricted, and has mounted Harley, it's cock buried in her pussy. It's panting as it's hips move rapidly. It's cock disappearing into Harley's pussy, her face is one of bliss. Her eyes aren't focused on anything other than the pleasure she's feeling, and her giggles follow the occasional gasp of pleasure.\n  I'm not certain how long I'm standing here watching it, until I hear Harley gasp, giggle and address me.\n  "Ah, hope you don't mind boss [ROOT.GetGirlWomanBoyMan]. I just had a itch, an da boys is helpin' ta scratch it.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1220a;Enjoy yourself Harley.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1220b;You disgust me Harley.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1220c;Well, her mouth is free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1220d;That's... hot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1221;I let Harley know that I've my own itch in need of scratching. She giggles as her animals continue to rut with her.\n  I walk up beside her and pull out my cock. The scene is arousing in a forbidden way, and as a result my cock is hard and ready. Harley smiles at me as she licks her lips. She runs her gloved fingers along my scrotum, and up the underside of my cock. It feels good. Very good and my cock twitches in approval.\n  With mischief in her eyes she begins stroking it, occasionally flicking her tongue across the underside of the head. Teasing with her fellatio.\n  I'm considering taking more control when Harley's eyes suddenly go wide and she gasps. Her body begins to tremble in orgasm and I look down to notice her pussy leaking semen as the hyena on top of her empties itself in her.\n  I give one of Harley's floppy jester ears a tug. Her eyes focus a bit, lust clearly in them and she begins to devour my cock.\n  I hiss in satisfaction as she works to bring me to release. I look down, and her eyes seem almost appreciative. Perhaps for not judging her for how she decided to scratch her itch. I find myself wink in response. Her eyes seem to sparkle. I can feel her appreciation, and she shows it as she takes all of me into her mouth.\n  I don't last much longer. The bestiality show, the expert fellatio, and from a beautiful woman. I explode. Harley doesn't pull away, instead her throat works to accept my seed, doing her best to swallow it all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1221a;Thanks for the release.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1222;Harley and the hyenas finish up. Harley coaxes them out and off of her. I watch as she pulls on her outfit, leaving their spunk within her.\n  "Mmm. Filling. Hey boss [ROOT.GetGirlWomanBoyMan], if you wanna, ya can borrow Harley's little fellas. I dun mind any. Afta' all. Sharin' is carin'."\n  I feel my pulse flutter at the thought. Harley seems to notice, her ability to psychoanalyze always churning.\n  "I know peeps will say it's taboo 'n stuff. But dat's part a the thrill an all. I myself, I'm a animal lover. The fur feels so soft and they get so excited it makes my head all warm and happy making them feel the same. Even if ya's more the kind that thinks its hot ta be dominated, dat's cool too. I think it's fine ta be an animal's bitch, as long as ya ain't no bitch ta me. Right?"\n  Of course there are different kinds. Some would be an animal lover who simply enjoys the intimacy of their animal partner, while others would enjoy the alpha dominance shown by their animal lover while bring breed. Being a bitch though could be dangerous. Having a subservient mindset could rise up at a bad time, and complicate running a realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1222a;I'm an animal lover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1222b;I'm a bitch to be breed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1222c;I'm already a lover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1222d;I'm already a bitch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1222e;Hot, but not for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1223;Harley grins widely at me. "Oh, boss is a bitch? Well, puddin' here is still a little pent up. Poor fella was on his back, and not able to really give it the ole' Vroom Vroom. Be a good lil' bitch would ya?"\n  My knees get weak as her hyena steps towards me. His cock still swollen and visible under him.\n  I shiver from the surprise realization that I've taken my clothing off. A part of my mind seems to question if this is right, but that thought seems far, far away. The hyena nudges my knee and already weakened, I find that I drop to all fours.\n  It sticks it's nose by my exposed ass, and takes a sniff. It's cool nose bumps up against my pussy and a shiver runs up my spine. It flicks its tongue across my gash, and a whimper escapes my lips.\n  "Come now boy, she's wet, willin', and gots more work ta do. Get to it."\n  The hyena seems to understand her words, and it climbs up to mount me. Clearly a beast used to mounting, it make a clear attempt to not claw me unnecessarily.\n  Once up, it's cock pokes around, seeking purchase. Harley giggles as she reaches down and guides it into me.\n  Once in, my breath is stolen. The hyena was clearly worked up, and the energy it wasn't able to release on Harley, is taken out on me. It's drilling me so hard, that I feel drool drip from my lips as my body rocks with each slam home.\n  A pair of orgasms later, I realize that Harley is chuckling as she is petting her boys. "You still with us boss?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1223a;That was intense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1230;I'm finishing up some business when the door is tossed open. My hand goes to my weapon, as a man clad in black and white, with an orangish-red mane steps into the room.\n  "Greetings [ROOT.GetBestName]! I am known as Syndrome, and I've come here for you."\n  As I brandish my weapon, his eyes go wide in surprise. Then, waving his hands he calls for me to wait.\n  "No, no, no. I didn't mean I've come for you as in I'm seeking to do you harm. What I mean is you're something of a role model to me, and I've come here to join you. You know, villain and villain. Do gooders beware. That kind of thing."\n  I'm still wary of this man, so I engage him in some questioning. While he's quite exuberant, he's clearly intelligent. He also was apparently quite the successful merchant before deciding to devote his life to his passion of villainy.\n  So he definitely has some positive qualities to add to my lands should I take him in. For negatives, well, he's also clearly ambitious, so that could lead to some friction down the road. Then again, do I really want to surround myself with nothing more than content drones?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1230a;I could use a man like you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1230b;You should just move along.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1230c;Leave my sight, and never return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1240;I'm relaxing in my study when the door bangs open, and a red faced Syndrome comes stomping into the room.\n  "ARGH! I can't believe it! Full disclosure, I wasn't always a villain. I actually sought to be a side kick when I was a kid, hoping to even grow up to be a hero. There was this guy, Mister Incredible they called him, he meant the world to me. I, I was his biggest fan. Anyway, I came to realize how poor of a role model he was. Sanctimonious hypocrite is all that he was. I thought he died, or retired even. But I just found out that he's still alive. Alive, and not that far away."\n  I relax and sip from my drink while Buddy paces back and forth, ranting and raving. His hatred for this Mister Incredible is impressive.\n  After a couple minutes, his rant seems to have reached its end. Now he's just standing there, seething while flexing his hands over and over. I decide to point out what Syndrome has obviously missed. He's no longer his past self. He's on the right path, and he's someone who can now stand up to this Mister Incredible. After all, every villain needs a good nemesis.\n  A grin slowly stretches across Syndrome's face. "You're right, of course. Now the perfect opportunity for me to show that muscle headed freak that not everyone is blinded by him. Heh. I, Syndrome, shall make Mr. Incredible regret the day he crossed my path!"\n  With a renewed vigor and a maniacal laugh, Buddy leaves my office and makes his way back down the hallway. I finish my drink and decide that it's time for me to get back to work as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1240a;Interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1245;I'm pouring myself a drink when Bob walks up to me. He's shaking a bit as he's laughing to himself.\n  "Oh hey, [ROOT.GetFirstName], get this, you know how being a hero and all that, we get fans and folks volunteering to be side kicks and stuff like that all the time? Well, there was this kid in the past, his name was Buddy, he went around calling himself Kid Incredible or The Incredible Kid, or something like that. Anyway, turns out he went full on villain out there. Claims that I'm what's wrong with the world, and that he'll be the end of me. I mean, I've had some odd rivals in my life, but I think this may be take the cake. You know what I'm saying?"\n  I ask Bob what he finds funny about it since he keeps chuckling. He responds about how the kid didn't have anything special about him from what he recalled, and that he's that he doesn't really take his new rival's declaration seriously. I warn him about that, pointing out the dangers of letting one's guard down.\n  Bob waves of the concern as he says goodbye. As he leaves, I hear him mumbling ideas about how he'll surprise his rival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1245a;Interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1250;It's a sunny day as I walk about the grounds. I hear the distinct laugh of Syndrome, and make my way over in that direction.\n  When I get there, I find that he's set-up a variety of targets. Many which are sporting small darts. I watch as Syndrome puts something into a bracer on his forearm. He points his arm in the direction of one of the targets, and then with a small chuckle, he pushes a button and a small arrow flies out and embeds itself along side the others already in the target.\n  I make a comment about the accurate shot, and Syndrome turns towards me. "Still a bit of a hitch in it, limited capacity too, but it's coming along well. I'll admit, I'm not the best suited for swinging around a hung of sharpened metal, so I felt the need to work on something that can help me be a little more... combat effective."\n  I watch Syndrome for a little longer, impressed by how every shot seems to include a chuckle of some kind. Clearly, he's getting pleasure out of his work. Suddenly feeling like a third wheel, I decide to leave him to his endeavors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1250a;Sounds useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1260;The black smoke billowing in the countryside sent a clear signal. Fire.\n  I call for my horse and am soon galloping towards the scene, with other concerned folks soon following along as well. It appears to be a small barn that is ablaze.\n  As I get closer, I spot a muscular man, clad in red and black, running into the blaze. Dismounting and calling out for a situation, the farm owner comes over and shares that he and his son had managed to clear the animals from the bard, yet his son became trapped inside when a beam fell and blocked his path.\n  As the farmer's account comes to an end, the brawny masked man, leaps out of the flames, carrying a young man. With the farmer's son saved, I congratulate the man on such heroics.\n  "All in a day's work. And thank you, I've heard of your deeds as well [ROOT.GetBestName]. I'm Bob, but most call me Mr. Incredible."\n  I learn that Bob has been on the move, looking for somewhere to settle down. Seeking a balance of a land worthy of raising a family, while also one that would have need of his skills. For while he's looking to settle down, he's not looking to retire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1260a;I could use a man like you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dw_hvevents1261;Bob Parr stops by to visit me with a woman that I've not seen before. She's also decked out in Red and Black, and I can now see what he meant about the desire for a good land to settle down in.\n  "Hey [ROOT.GetFirstName], this is Helen. Some folks call her Elastigirl. I'm certain you can tell that she's a hero as well. Just figured it'd be wise to stop by and introduce her to you an all."\n  I spend some time chatting with the couple. I learn that Helen was performing heroic deeds before she met Bob. I also learn that they've kids. A pair of them. A daughter named Violet who's just come of age, as well as a young son named Dashiell, who's a couple years younger. She's both proud and concerned about her children. They've both expressed a desire to be heroes themselves, and have actually participated in a couple heroic actions already.\n  A family of heroes, a boon to many a realm. It's just a question of if they're a good fit here.\n  GAMEPLAY: if you banish Elastigirl or tell her to never appear again - then the kids will also disappear. You can also decide if Elastigirl will be married or just romantically involved with Mr. Incredible based on your response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1261a;I welcome his wife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dw_hvevents1270;I've heard word that there is an exotic woman with hair the color of fire, which has been helping people across the land. They've even taken to calling her Starfire in recognition of her skill and look.\n A couple days later, I'm heading to my court, when I notice a beautiful woman, with red flowing hair that greatly resembles a flame, who is sitting on the edge of a building. I stop and approach her, noticing that she's lost in thought.\n  Once I'm close, I call out and ask if all is well. She smiles at me, and shifts a backpack that is behind her.\n  "Hello friend. I've heard of you. You are [ROOT.GetBestName], yes? I was given the name Kori A'ndr."\n  I hit her up with some questions and learn that she climbed up to her current perch to get a better view of the morning sun, which she apparently adores very much. I also learn that she's on the run. She apparently has a sister that made a power move and took control of the family estate and sought to imprison her, even though her only crime was apparently being the chosen heiress.\n  I ask her a little more about her situation, and she acknowledges that she has not seen any pursuers for quite some time, but she lacks a place to call home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1270a;You're welcome to stay here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1270b;Well, good luck in your travels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1270c;Leave my sight, and never return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1280;During a slow day in court, I agree to take a stroll around the market with my [ROOT.GetTreasurerName]. They've got some ideas to help draw in more commerce, but figured a change of venue for the talk would be best.\n  We arrive at the market to witness some commotion. There is a flash of fire atop a near by building and the sound of a struggle. We see a masked figure slide down the roof and leaping off behind a row of merchant stalls. Starfire is apparently giving chase as she bounds across the roof top. Only, she slips instead of slides, and takes a tumble off the rooftop and directly into a merchant's stall.\n  This only slows her a bit, as she stumbles out of it and resumes her pursuit. There is a gasp from people as she doesn't seem to notice she herself has a pursuer. An angry parrot from the stall is flying after her, squawking towards her with frustration.\n  The noise catches her attention, and Starfire slows and turns. The parrot slams into her, toppling her backwards into some bushes. The two disappear briefly before rolling out in a cloud of dust.\n  I rush over and find Starfire looking stunned, while an angry parrot that gives her an earful.\n  "This day has not been good." Tears well up in Starfires eyes, and even the parrot seems to calm. "I fear I have done more harm than good."\n  I look and notice whoever she was pursuing is long gone. Meanwhile, the parrot's merchant has caught up and is lamenting the damage to his stall and bird.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1280a;You need to do better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1280b;We all have bad days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1280c;Here's gold for the stall and parrot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1290;I'm looking over some court documents when Starfire slips into my study. She's smiling as she slides up by my chair.\n  "I was taking in the beautiful morning sun, when I was thoughts of things I like were dancing across my mind. One of those things I realized was you. I was raised to not be ashamed of what I feel. And I feel that I fancy you [ROOT.GetFirstName]."\n  Her eyes seem to sparkle as she smiles at me. I suddenly realize that I've no recollection at all about what I was reading.\n  "This is where you should tell me of your thoughts towards me."\n  I shake my head as if to gain focus. I then return her gaze and decide to give her my answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1290a;I'm interested in you too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1290b;Let's just be friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1290c;Not right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1290d;Don't bother me again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1300;I received word of a hero and villain conflict from one of my guards that was taking place in a nearby building. I prepare myself and head out to take a look at the disturbance to see if I need to get involved.\n  When I arrive, I find Harley and one of her hyenas have apparently subdued Batgirl, as she's bound on the floor. Harley sees me and gives me a big grin.\n  "What's up boss [ROOT.GetGirlWomanBoyMan]? Did ya come over ta watch? I was about to have my boy here teach her a lesson for trying ta jump me."\n  I see Harley's hyena bite and pull at the fabric of Batgirl's outfit. The hyena's engorged cock making it clear the lesson Harley wants to teach Batgirl. With eyes wide in panic, Batgirl calls out to me.\n  "Please, Harley stole from a market and I was just doing my duty in attempting to apprehend her to retrieve what she took. I've done nothing wrong, please help me."\n  Harley giggles and pulls out a simple necklace, with a silver wrought pendant. She spins it on her finger. "Oh dis thing? I was just admiring it. Must'a forgot to put it back.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1300a;Sure, have your fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1300b;Just let her go Harley.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1300c;Let's just put her in prison.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1300d;Harley, you need some prison time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1301;I watch as Harley's hyena tugs at the fabric covering Batgirl's crotch until it's torn away. It then nuzzles her, taking a good sniff. Batgirl's pleading for it to stop comes to a halt, when the hyena begins to lick her pussy. The act causes her to gasp in shock.\n  Wasting no time, the hyena climbs up on Batgirl's back, the act forcing her torso down and forcing her ass up. Harley squats down and takes the beasts engorged cock and lines it up with Batgirl's pussy.\n  "Would ya look at that? I think he really likes ya."\n  The hyena once aligned, begins to pump its hips. As its cock slides in and out, Batgirl resumes her pleading, with tears clearly whelming up in her eyes.\n  The hyena could care less, it just continues to increase the speed of its hips as it pounds away. The force of its thrusts interrupting Batgirl's pleas, and causing her to mix in grunts as she takes it.\n  The hyena is really into it, it's jaw slack and tongue dangling as it hammers away. It's drool is dripping down on Batgirl's face, and her pleading has all but ended as her face is a mix of confused emotions.\n  The hyena gives a sporadic shake as it's hips tremble. Harley hoots, as the hyena's seed can be seen trickling out of Batgirl's pussy.\n  "Good boy. So, what's do we do with her now boss?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1301.1;I watch as Harley's hyena tugs at the fabric covering Batgirl's crotch until it's torn away. It then nuzzles her, taking a good sniff. Batgirl moans and arches her back, which the hyena takes as an invitation and begins to lick her pussy. The act causes her to gasp and her body trembles.\n  "Would ya look at that boss? Harley's thinking that Batgirl may be a little bitch."\n  Batgirl offers no objections, as the hyena climbs up to mount her. Harley squats down and guides the hyena's cock to where it's rubbing Batgirl's pussy. Harley asks Batgirl how bad she needs it. After a brief pause, Batgirl relents. "Please, please put him in me."\n  The hyena once aligned, begins to pump its hips. As its cock slides in and out, Batgirl sounds like she's clearly enjoying it. The hyena continues to increase the speed of its hips as it pounds away. The force of its thrusts interrupting Batgirl's moans with gasps as it slams itself deep.\n  The hyena is really into it, it's jaw slack and tongue dangling as it hammers away. It's drool is dripping down on Batgirl's face. She's clearly lost in the moment, her hips shaking as her second orgasm ripples through her.\n  The hyena itself gives a sporadic shake as it's hips tremble. Harley hoots, as the hyena's seed can be seen trickling out of the sated Batgirl's pussy.\n  "Good boy. So, what's do we do with her now boss?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1301a;Let's let her go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1301b;Let's put her in prison.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1310;I hear Harley's maniacal laugh and I decide to go investigate, just in case there is some damage control I need to take care off.\n  When I find her, I'm treated to quite an unexpected scene. Batgirl isn't bound, doesn't appear to have been subdued, yet her ass is up in the air and one of Harley's hyena's is rutting away.\n  "How do ya like them apples ya do-gooder?"\n  "I... ungh... will never... ungh... relent to... ungh, yes... to evil!"\n  I've no idea what the look was on my face, but Harley's chuckle drew my attention back to her and she was looking at me.\n  "Hey there boss [ROOT.GetGirlWomanBoyMan]. The Batgirl and I were just doin' a little roleplaying. No one's causing any real trouble tonight. Well, at least we aren't anyway."\n  I see the other hyena over in the corner, watching the proceeds. He appears to be spent, and judging from the scent and drying liquids, I'm guessing he's already played his role.\n  "Oh please... ungh... fuck me...ungh... yes..."\n  "There she goes again. You're supposed ta pretend ya don't like gettin' drilled like that."\n  I watch as Batgirl climaxes. It's clearly a powerful one as she peaks, yet the hyena keeps hammering away.\n  "Was there somethin' ya wanted boss?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1310a;Continue to enjoy your fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1310b;You both disgust me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents1320;I'm walking in the vicinity of the Wizard's Tower when I hear the maniacal laugh of the Joker. Imagining the potential problems that could arise if the Joker is disturbing the Tower's mages, I decide to go and see what's got him cackling so heartily.\n  I find him in front of the tower, admiring a staff. There's something a little different about him. Then he begins laughing again, just before slamming the staff down on the ground. The ground then roils with energy, giving an almost putrid green glow before dissipating. The Joker then notices me and grins from ear to ear.\n  "Hahaha, can you believe it [ROOT.GetFirstName]? I'm a fucking hairy wizard! Hahahaha. Or is it I'm fucking Harry the Wizard?"\n  After he's done amusing himself, I learn that the Joker has actually been spending time learning at the Wizard's Tower, and he has apparently finally finished his mage training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dw_hvevents2011;It wasn't always easy squeezing in time to conduct my training, yet I remained committed to my mission.\n  I went through various combat situations in my mind, in order to try an anticipate the unexpected. Spent countless hours destroying practice targets, and dozens more practicing against my guards and more able servants.\n  My improvement may not be vast over these past months, yet it is there. The guardsmen who've squared off against me the most can appreciate it.\n  The world is a dangerous place, and every little bit I can improve will only serve me well in the long run.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents2011a;I've improved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents2012;It hasn't been easy. As a woman, I'm often expected to be clean, proper in my appearance. A doll to be viewed, not one to be played with.\n  I reject such concepts, as my training has been filled with sweat, blisters, bruises, and the hardening of callouses.\n  Finding people to practice with isn't always easy. I often hear that people are concerned for my well being as they decline, yet I highly suspect that what they're really concerned about is that they may end up losing to a woman. So most of my time was spent fighting against dummy targets. At least that was until I learned of a nearby ruin that on evenings where rain was in the air, slimes would amass in considerable numbers.\n  While they're not really a threat, as even children can defeat or escape from them, their numbers provided me a good practice partner in which to hone my skills.\n  The end result is improvement over these past months.  I can feel my body moves better, and my weapon feels more natural in my hands. The few who aren't afraid to practice with a woman have commented upon my improvements as well.\n  The world is a dangerous place, and every little bit I can improve will only serve me well in the long run.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents2012a;I've improved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents2013;My training has come a long way from when I started. I've gone from having difficulty finding willing practice partners, to now having a ready supply of them. There's even other women among them, clearly emboldened by my growth.\n  While some of the men hold greater skill, I do find significant joy in practicing against other women. They tend to let their emotions boil over, and our sessions quickly become heated, pushing us both further in our goal of mastery.\n  Some of the practice sessions even involved some side bets from what I've learned. Interestingly enough, I find myself mixed with pride and anger. Pride from those who've bet upon me, and anger at those foolish enough to bet against me.\n  In the end though, my growth continues. As I become more able to handle myself, I am better able to face the challenges of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents2013a;I've improved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents2013b;I should get a cut of the betting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents2014;Improving my combat capabilities doesn't have to be all about swinging a weapon around, while beating on practice targets or opponents. I find that getting out hunting more often helps as well. It sharpens my senses, helping me become more aware of my surroundings. I select prey that helps push my skills. Improving my aim, and my reaction time not only help me while hunting, but also while on a battlefield or a duel.\n  I have to slip out unannounced though, as having my normal hunting entourage lessens the need to rely on my own skills. So to push myself further, I set out alone.\n  With each successful outing, I improve myself. The world becomes sharper, and it's dangers more pronounced, yet I feel better capable of facing them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents2014a;I've improved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents2014b;I give my kills to those in need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents2015;It's not easy being strong. Practice dummies break down quicker. Sparring partners seldom adequately draw out my potential as I usually have to restrain myself to keep from injuring them.\n  It's frustrating at the best of times, and infuriating at the worst of them. I've still maintained my course though. I cannot improve if I stop.\n  Thankfully the land is occasionally cursed with an abnormal beast. A natural creature, that has undergone unnatural growth. Many folks claim that these creatures are spawn of the devil, while others claim they are symbols of a god. Regardless of what's really causing them, I'm thankful for their existence as these creatures provide me with a challenge that I can apply my full strength towards.\n  It's often dangerous, yet they are just a small part of the world, so building myself to overcome these challenges puts me in a better position to handle whatever else the world throws at me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents2015a;I've improved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents2015b;I've improved and I ensure everyone knows of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents2020;For the past six months, I've taken the time to patrol the land. Assisting those in need, and thwarting the actions of those seeking to do ill.\n  I can tell my actions were also appreciated by the populace. When I first began, my patrols were quiet, as those I came across spared me little more than a wary glance. As my patrolling comes to an end, now those I came across call out their greetings and thanks for my protection.\n  With this mission done, it's time to consider what my next one shall be. More of the same, or something new?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents2020a;My work is complete.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents2030;I've spent the past six months working with traveling merchants, the occasional shop keeper, and even visited church a couple times. The folks were always happy to donate their excess money to me, as a token of their appreciation.\n  Sure, some folks may have balked at contributing, and thus required a little extra convincing, but by and large people were pretty cooperative. After all, opting to pay a little coin today, allows one the opportunity to live and earn more coin in the future. While not contributing, would result in any coin on hand being lost, along with a lack of future earning potential.\n  The only question now, is what do I want to do for my next mission? Perhaps a little more extortion, or something else?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents2030a;Fair gains for fair robbery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents2040;Eureka! My hard work has finally paid off. After putting in long hours, experiencing setbacks and successes, I've finally completed my work.\n  I've two options to choose. The first one provides a bump to the techpoints of my land, selected at random. This symbolizes an advancement that impacts those beyond just me.\n  The second one provides a character modifier. This represents a piece of equipment or a gear upgrade that provides a temporary benefit directly to me. (lasts 12 months).\n  Now, which will it be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents2040a;Random Tech Points.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dw_hvevents2500;Word has reached me that [dw_decision_target.GetBestName] has identified me as a nemesis. I can't help but wonder, is such a declaration necessary?\n  Regardless, with this knowledge, I now know I need to plan accordingly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dw_hvevents8100;After some work, I'm in the same room as my target. I begin the mental focus exercises to shape my will into spear.\n  Once formed, I project it out towards my target.

dw_hvevents8130;My connection worked, now, what shall I do?\n\n  Let's be lovers will make us lovers. A difficult bit to convincingly put into place.\n  Become obedient puts on very friendly terms, plus they should be very supportive of my decisions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dw_hvevents8130b;Become obedient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents8140;As my mental assault slams home, [mind_control_target.GetFirstName] stiffens. They scan the room briefly until their gaze meets mine. The anger in their eyes is clear.\n  At some level, perhaps an instinctual one, they realize that I just tried to invade their mind. As a result, our relationship will most certainly worsen.\n  Alas, my actions clearly entailed risk. Now I'll just need to decide how to handle this going forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents8140a;Not what I was hoping for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents8150;As my mental assault slams home, [mind_control_target.GetFirstName] stiffens. Then they slouch forward and grab their head. The look on their face appears to be one of confusion. Clearly, I failed to establish a foothold and simply knocked them for a mental loop.\n  After a bit, they excuse themselves, muttering about a headache as they leave.\n  I find myself rubbing my own temples. While I don't have a headache, I've just expended the mental energy I built up unsuccessfully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_hvevents8150a;Bah, failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
