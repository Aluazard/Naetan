## Events
DWFairyTales100;My carriage stops by a small town on our way back to the capital. While walking about the town square I just miss running into a young lady who was distracted by a book she was reading. Startled, she blushes and says, "My apologies my [Root.GetLordLady], I didn't notice you." \n  I accept her apology and inquire about her reading. "My father taught me how to read, he was a travelling merchant, before settling down here to work as the cobbler." \n  I find it pleasant speaking with the young woman. I learn her name is Belle, and that she maintains her father's books. When I ask about what she feels is worth visiting in town, she shares, "Besides my father's shop, folks enjoy the bakery, hunting in the nearby lands, or relaxing with some song and drink in the lodge." \n  I fear I must go, but perhaps I'll visit in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales100A;I can now visit the town from my Intrigue menu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales111;The small village is bustling with activity. I notice the people are rather upbeat. A pleasant difference from the stress that can often be found at the capital. \n  I was given several recommendations by Belle on places to visit. After some consideration I believe I shall stop by...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales111A;Visit the Cobbler;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales111B;Visit the Bakery;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales111C;Visit the Lodge;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales111D;Go hunting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales111E;Visit Belle and the Beast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales121;I find the Cobbler's easy enough. It's a small shop, just off the town centre. An older gentleman is working away at his trade, with a variety of well made shoes around the shop. \n  I clear my throat and the old cobbler looks up almost startled. "Good day! Welcome to my shop. Are you looking for some reliable footwear?" \n  If he's Beauty's father, she must be youngest of several siblings, or perhaps he just got lucky in his advanced age. I return his smile and say...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales121A;I'd like to purchase a comfortable set of shoes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales121B;Is your daughter Belle around?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales121C;I'm just here to look around today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales140;Belle's father points at a door near the back of his shop. "She's probably back there reading. You're free to go see her. She gets on me if I turn away visitors." \n  I pass through the door and make my way towards the back where I find Belle sitting against a wall, reading contently in the warm afternoon sun that shines through the window. Like her father, she doesn't notice me right away. I'm about to clear my throat and gain her attention when I notice her bite her lip and make a simple gesture of rubbing a finger across a nipple that I can see straining under her top. With a smile, I clear my throat. \n  Belle's eyes go wide in shock and she stands upright. She blushes before composing herself. "It's nice to see you again. I was just getting some reading in before my afternoon chores.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales140A;I brought a book for you from Paris called L'amour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales140B;I brought a book for you from the East. The Kama Sutra.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales140C;Would you join me for a hunting trip?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales140D;Join me for a drink at the lodge?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales149;Belle's father taps his chin thoughtfully. "You know, I'm not really certain where she's at my [Root.GetLordLady]. I've not seen her all day." \n  I ponder things for a moment. Could it be that I've miss understood where an event was supposed to be taking me? Or is it simply a case where DEWGuru hasn't expanded the story line further. After all, he does bounce around and doesn't always fully complete the larger event chains. Of course, I could be seeing this in error as well. \n  With too many unanswered questions, I nod and wave to the cobbler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales149A;Okay, thank you for your time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales150;Belle's eyes brighten as she takes the book. She smiles as she rubs the cover. "I've heard about this book. It's about the love a knight has for a lady, yet his duties make it difficult for them to be together. It's somewhat of a tragedy, yet very romantic as it explores what it is to love." \n  I can't help but smile in return to Belle's exuberant smile. "I remembered you enjoyed books, and hoped you'd like it." \n  Belle clutches it to her chest, "I'll read it twice, no, three times through. Oh it's a wonderful gift [Root.GetFirstName]. I'd begin now, but I fear it's time I take care of my duties." \n  She hesitates then, for just a moment as though making up her mind, then she steps towards me, looks up into my eyes and gives the softest kiss upon my cheek. "Until next time my [Root.GetLordLady].";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales150A;I look forward to seeing you again Belle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales160;Belle's eyes seem to sparkle as she takes the book. She flips though it and gasps, before slamming shut and giggling. "I'd heard that it had drawings of... different ways..., you know. Any way, it originally was only written word, and pictures were added later to help those with trouble comprehending what was written." \n  I'm uncertain what interests me more. The fact that she's not offended by the very suggestive book, or that she's actually familiar with its history. I realize I'm staring at her rather intently as I ponder the thought, which causes her to blush deeply. \n  "I look forward to reading it my [Root.GetLordLady] and am very thankful for the gift. I fear I must go begin work, yet I assure you that if you visit again, I'll be able to discuss it with you, should you wish.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales160A;I look forward to discussing it with you Belle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales170;Belle's smile fades a bit when I mention hunting. "My [Root.GetLordLady], I regret that I've no interest in hunting. In fact, while I find hunters rather fascinating, I fear that I've been found to have quite the weak stomach around the death of an animal. Especially those that are cute and cuddly." \n  While her reasoning isn't uncommon, it's interesting to see her seem to feel genuinely bad for turning me down. Until she perks up for a moment as idea obviously strikes her. \n  "Gaston! He's our best hunter in the area, and extremely popular as well. I'm certain he'd make a great hunting partner and your bounty would be grand. I must be starting my chores soon, but I could introduce you to him first.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales170A;Please do introduce me to Gaston.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales170B;I fear I've not the time today. Until next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales180;Belle introduces me to a broad shouldered, strapping young man with a strong chin and an air of confidence about him. "Gaston, I'd like to introduce you to [Root.GetBestName]. [Root.GetSheHeCap] is interested in going on a hunt, and I recommended you." \n  Gaston bows towards me, sweeping his hand in an exaggerated fashion. "Gaston is honored to hunt with you. We shall bring down quite the prize today." As if to emphasize his point, he puffs out his chest and gives it a thump with his fist. He then turns towards Belle and gives her a wink while flashing an impressively large smile. Belle smiles and excuses herself. \n  "Ah, a wildcat waiting to be tamed that one. The day wears on though, let's get started.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales180A;I hope the game is worth the company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales185;The hunt goes surprisingly well. While Gaston is clearly not lacking in the self-confidence department, he is indeed an excellent hunter, capable at both tracking, giving pursuit, and his aim with a bow is true. As the day draws to a close and we're returning with our game, I find that I did indeed enjoy the trip. Then Gaston offers forth an idea. \n  "The Belle, she's quite the looker. Did you know that she will take a picnic by herself in the woods? She doesn't realize that I watch over her, which makes her refusing me all the more difficult. Next time you visit, if she's having a picnic, I'd be willing to show you. Perhaps together we can get her to show us appreciation for watching over her. What say you my [Root.GetLordLady]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales185A;I like the idea. I'll see you next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales185B;I'll have to pass on your offer Gaston.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales185C;What about you and I instead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales185D;I appreciate the hunt Gaston. Until next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales190;Gaston looks at me in earnest, as though he's sizing me up. Then shrugging he says, "It not every day a ruler asks to bed me, so I'd be a fool to refuse. Besides, I'd be lying if I were to say it was my first time with a man." \n  We end up returning to Gaston's home, where his over the top energy continues as after stripping down, he takes the time (and great pleasure) in showing off his well sculpted body. \n  After the show is over, Gaston moves onto sex with the a gusto. It's a cock fight initially. Lot's of slapping, rubbing, and wrestling for position. Gaston obviously enjoys being the dominate one, and while he continues to talk, it's somehow stimulating. He also shows that he's not lacking in stamina. By the time we're done, almost two hours have passed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales190A;Attend my court, I'd like you as my lover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales190B;It was a good finish to a good hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales195;With his large exaggerated motions, Gaston bows before me. "What man of sound mind could consider turning down [Root.GetBestName]?" \n  Soon after I find myself at Gaston's home, a cosy, well made place with the décor fitting of an overly masculine hunter of notable skill. I sip my wine as I recline by the fire place as Gaston enters the room. He's naked and with his amazingly large smile, begins to go through various poses, showing me every aspect of his lean fit body. I applaud him has he finishes and struts over to me. \n  For the next couple of hours, I'm amazed by the stamina and skill Gaston displays. I couldn't do anything more than stammer out an agreement as he was pounding my pussy with his large dick, while proudly proclaiming, "No one fucks like Gaston!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales195A;Gaston, attend my court and be my lover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales195B;A fine finish to the hunt before I head home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales199;With his large exaggerated motions, Gaston bows before me. "I gladly accept on one condition. Please explain that." Gaston's pointing at the bulge in my pants where my cock is straining in excitement from the hunt. Shrugging, I answer honestly, "It's a cock. I'm blessed with the equipment of both man and woman." \n  Gaston nods and after a bit I find myself in his home, naked in front of a warm fire, sipping wine as he's tossing off his clothing between poses that show off his muscular body. He finishes his show as I finish my wine. \n  I wondered if he would show apprehension at being with me, but he showed no hesitance at all in fucking me silly, while also stroking my cock. I almost lost it when near the end as he allowed me to fuck his ass, and he said, "No one has an ass like Gaston.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales199A;Gaston, attend my court and be my lover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales199B;Thank you Gaston for the hunt and tumble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales201;I can easily see the draw, as the lodge is a warm inviting place. Belle introduces me to the various people in the room, who all greet me with their best bow or curtsy, along with a sincere smile. Even a large muscular fellow named Gaston, who's love for himself almost oozes from him, managed to greet me rather appropriately. \n  A table in the far corner, where some farmers are enjoying an evening drink, breaks out in a simple drinking song, which soon spreads around the entire lodge. \n  I notice Belle looking at me to measure whether I approve of the outburst of song, to which I smile and urge her to join in. She does so, showing a fine voice that seems to further encourage others. \n  Soon, we make our way over to a table. She smiles and asks "Have you a preference my [Root.GetLordLady]?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales201A;I keep the drinks and conversation flowing to get Belle drunk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales201B;I ply my skills at seduction on Belle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales201C;I hold an enlightened conversation with Belle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales201D;I have a drink and enjoy Belle's fine company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales210;We're making small talk about the place as Belle is highlighting its importance to the town. "There is always someone here it seems, and come evening, more folks stop by for a drink, stories, and the occasional song." \n  The tavern maid stops by with a pair of ale's. I take a healthy draw from the mug. It's stout, full bodied with just a hint of sweet flavor. I smile at Belle and compliment both the ale and the company. She blushes as she takes a small drink of her own. \n  We have a pleasant conversation that is very relaxing. I feel the strain of leadership ease away as we talk about life, ideas and dreams. \n  When I ask Belle about her own dreams, her eyes shine brightly for a moment before a sadness comes over them. "I fear it's gotten late, and I must return home before father worries.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales210A;Belle, let me help you. What's wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales210B;I understand. Until next time then Belle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales220;Belle looks at me, her eyes searching mine as though seeking hope. "I fear I'm cursed. It is my fate to be given to the Beast in order to sate its hunger. Every generation a woman is given to him, else death visits each family." \n  I've only heard of such a beast in the tales shared by mothers who are trying to scare their children. I carefully probe the truthfulness of Belle's plight. \n  "Even with all the books I've read, I figured such a fate was little more than a fable meant to scare children. Until the Beast appeared and marked me as its future tribute." \n  Belle describes the Beast in great detail, a monstrous thing that shows intelligence and the ability to communicate clearly. The village doesn't discuss it as apparently those who tried in the past wound up dead. Sacrifice and prosper, or resist and die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales220A;I shall do my best to save you Belle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales221;Belle's eyes begin to tear up some and then she hugs me tightly. "Thank you. I... I shouldn't have told you as I've put the village in danger and you as well." \n  I return Belle's hug until she releases her grip on me. Wiping away her tears, she manages a smile. "I must return home before father worries. I'll not bother you again with my plight, but should you find a way to help me, I will forever be in your debt." \n  Belle places a quick kiss on my cheek and then hurries off back to her father's home. Leaving me with my thoughts of this Beast on my trip back to the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales221A;This beast shall not claim another in my lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales230;I learn that Belle's reading habits apparently range far and wide. We've read a number of the same books, and share interest in others. I come to realize that Belle's familiarity with books that we both read may exceed mine, to which she offers that in not having the same access to a wide selection like myself, she ends up re-reading some multiple times. \n  It seems like only minutes pass when we realize we're one of the few left in the lodge. Belle blushes and apologizes for time slipping away so quickly, but that she must hurry home as her father is obviously worried. We share a hug and agree that it was a most stimulating evening. \n  My trip home has me pondering a wealth of new ideas as I consider her insight on various topics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales230A;I've so many new ideas to work through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales240;You ply your seductive skills on the young Beauty. Using her obvious love for reading as a great way to hit her up with some of the more obscure love poems, which soon leave her blushing with the occasional comment about how warm the lodge has become. \n  I slowly build up my touching her. From our hands brushing against each other as we reach for something on the table to my softly brushing back a stray hair. Soon we're closer and as the poetry flows, my hand finds a comfortable resting place upon her soft hand. \n  She puts forth a nervous question about why I would take the time to sit with a simple daughter of a cobbler. I reply by complimenting her and explaining how rare a combination beauty and intelligence are. \n  The night grows long, and she mentions a need to return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales240A;I bid her good evening, allowing the seed to grow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales240B;I offer instead we retire somewhere more private.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales240C;I offer instead to have a private poetry reading.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales250;Belle seems to hesitate, so I take her gently by the hand and guide her to a room I reserved in the lodge. She follows along muttering that her father will certainly be okay, and she blushes a bit as a short portly man's eyes bulge in his sockets as I lead her into the room. \n  I continue with the compliments as I unwrap her smooth skin from the confines of her clothing. Her breathing deepens and she trembles slightly as my fingers brush her skin. She is a Beauty. I kiss her passionately, and her body responds as though it were starved for such affection. \n  She is inexperienced, yet very eager as we explore each other. With our passion at a height, I take her virginity, seeking to introduce pleasure instead of pain. After a minute her passion returns and we continue into the morning hours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales250A;Return with me my Beauty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales250B;Thank you for sharing your fine company with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales260;I watch as the beautiful Belle goes from a woman basking in the after glow of some excellent love making, to a woman who appears to have been informed of the death of a loved one. I ask if I said something that offended her. \n  She shakes her head and quietly mutters, "It is not you my [Root.GetLordLady]. I fear I am unable to leave with you, regardless of how I wish I could." \n  Something is clearly going on, as this level of despair surpasses even that of a controlling parent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales260A;I encourage Belle to share her plight with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales270;We share some our favorite provocative poetry verses as we make our way to the room that I reserved in the lodge. Our exchange seems to pass over the heads of the brutish males in the lodge, as we disappear into the safety of the room. \n  As two women, we disrobe and appreciate each others bodies. As my breasts are freed of their clothing, Belle cups them with her small hands and shares that she never considered the excitement she may feel with another woman. I trace my fingers down the middle of her back as I breath warmly on her neck, followed by a kiss and an embrace that pulls her body against mine. I feel her nipples stiffen and a moan escapes her lips. "My Beauty, who better to understand the pleasure points of a woman, other than a woman herself?" \n  All too soon, the time for my departure draws near.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales270A;Return with me my Beauty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales270B;Thank you for sharing your fine company with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales281;The bakery seems to be a fine establishment, with a fresh selection of warm oven baked bread, or some good travel bread with the thick crust that goes great with a warm soup. \n  After spending time going over the selection, I settle one of the fresh warm ones. The baker is kind enough to insist that I have it for free, as a thanks for taking the time to visit his shop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales281A;Yummy. I love warm buns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales291;The lodge is a warm and inviting place, filled with a variety of people from the small town. I look around briefly for Belle and don't notice her anywhere. I take a seat by a table that's off to the side, where I can take in my surroundings. An attractive bar maid recommends their seasonal ale, and I accept it. \n  The lodge is lively with more than one person recognizing me and wishing me well on my visit and travels. Outside of the bar maid and farmers, there is a very muscular and confident young man named Gaston who appears to be an accomplished hunter based on his tales. He in turn is flanked by a trio of women, who all appear to be related, and may even be triplets. Gaston also has a yes man of sorts, a portly dwarf who reminds me of a dog begging for scraps. \n  In all, an interesting mix of people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales291A;I enjoy the atmosphere and relax.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales291B;I 'tip' the bar maid to serve me in my room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales291C;I'll join Gaston for some bragging.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales300;Having moved to a room in the lodge, I sit down and enjoy a drink while the bar maid, who I've come to know as Babette, provides me with a provocative strip tease. I commend her on her skill, to which she responds, "We may be a small town my [Root.GetLordLady], but we've enough travellers visit to where I can practice." Her eyes flash mischievously at her open proclamation at being a cheap whore. \n  I slouch a bit in the chair and spread my legs. "Come then, show me the skill you've obtained with that mouth of yours." \n  Babette kneels between my legs and runs her hands up my legs, avoiding that which I desire her to service. The teasing sensation works as my body responds, yearning for release. Finally Babette services me. Showing a skill that speaks to experience. Bringing me to a strong finish, Babette smiles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales300A;Service with a smile, as it should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales310;Gaston's crew is very accommodating. Even with Gaston obviously thinking so highly of himself, he doesn't turn away one interested in sharing or hearing tales. \n  I learn that the trio of blondes are indeed triplets. Their names are Claudette, Laurette, and Paulette. The portly dwarven man is apparently named LeFou. \n  A lively bunch, Gaston also shows a penchant for tavern songs, as he belts one out that is soon sung by the whole lodge. As the evening wears on, Gaston asks me if I've tales of my own to share, or if I'm content hearing of his exploits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales310A;I share some hunting tales of my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales310B;I share some tales of my martial prowess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales310C;I sit back and enjoy Gaston's tales.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales320;I share tales of my hunts, and I quickly gain the respect of Gaston and his crew. I finish one where I took down a charging stag before it struck, and Gaston gives an approving shout. "My [Root.GetLordLady], you're a true hunter who can appreciate the joys of facing nature and coming out the victor. For myself, there is only one that has continued to elude my grasp." \n  Gaston's announcement seems to deflate the upbeat spirit of the triplets. Curious, I inquire as to this elusive game. \n  "It's the Beauty, Belle, the cobbler's daughter. I know where she reads while on picnic in the woods, and I've mind to strike and claim the prize. However, I'm willing to share it with another able hunter such as yourself, if you're interested." Gaston slaps the ass of Paulette. "Or we can enjoy ourselves with these ladies.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales320A;I accept Gaston's offer to 'hunt' Belle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales320B;I decline Gaston's offer to 'hunt' Belle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales320C;I accept Gaston's offer to join him and the triplets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales320D;I thank you for the company and wish you a good night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales330;I retire with Gaston and the three blonde triplets to finish off the great evening with a small orgy. When we reach Gaston's place, he pulls out his already stiff cock and sits upon a large chair, made from past hunting trophies. The triplets immediately descend upon him, two taking the task of massaging his muscles while the third kneels before him with lust filled eyes. She goes down on him, gagging as she tries to stuff it all in, while gazing upwards in search of approval. Gaston does his best to remain aloof, which seems to urge the women to work harder at pleasing him. \n  More than ready myself, I motion towards one who's massaging Gaston. She blushes and comes to me, dropping her blouse to free her breasts. I pull her do me, grinding my groin against her as I kiss her deeply. She moans and swoons in my grasp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales330A;I turn her around and lift her skirt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales333;As I slap my stiff cock on her ass, her sister comes over and offers, "My [Root.GetLordLady], Laurette loves it in the ass, would you be willing to accommodate her?" I nod in affirmation, as Laurette's sister spreads Laurette's ass cheeks and spits to help lubricate the coming penetration. \n  Laurette moans and rocks back as though searching for my cock, while her sister continues to keep Laurette's ass cheeks spread, giving me a clear target to Laurette's twitching sphincter. Deciding to first lubricate my cock a little more, I opt not to plunge into her ass, and instead bury my cock in her pussy. She whimpers in disappointment, until I pull out and slide my cock into her ass. \n  She trembles with pleasure and drool drips from her mouth as I pound her ass. Grunting, I explode within her tight hole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales333A;Our orgy continues for another hour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales336;I pull down her undergarments to put her ass and pussy on display. She looks back over her shoulder at me with a nervous smile. I meet her gaze and grin as I trace my fingers softly around her ass and vulva. Her face blushes and her breathing deepens some. "Such an easy whore," I mutter before giving her ass a good smack. She squeals in delight and one of her sisters giggles at the sound. \n  After a little more foreplay, I decide to feed my hunger as I trace my tongue along her gash. Her juices are flowing and her breathing is erratic. I alternate between her clit and her pussy while giving the occasional swat, and it isn't long before her knees are shaking as an orgasm rolls over her. She drops to the floor, and I give her another swat. She turns to look at me, and I lean back and spread my legs for it's my turn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales336A;Our orgy continues for another hour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales340;I share tales of my martial prowess, the people I've fought and soldiers I've led. I quickly gain the respect of Gaston and his crew. After finishing an account of one of my recent difficult contests, Gaston gives an approving shout. "My [Root.GetLordLady], you're a true warrior who can appreciate the joys of facing a challenge and coming out the victor." \n  I nod in appreciate of the recognition and his crew and some nearby farmers give some applause for the tale. Setting his mug down, Gaston continues, "Alas, it is growing late. If you've the time, I'd like to invite you to assist me in enjoying ourselves with these fine young ladies." To accentuate his point, he gives one of the triplets a nice slap on the ass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales340A;I accept Gaston's offer to join him and the triplets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales340B;I thank you for the company, but I must decline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales351;It's perfect hunting weather. I take to the forest and quickly find myself outpacing my retainers. There is an energy about the forest, and it seems to draw me in, so I press forward as they fall behind. \n  As I'm moving through the woods, I catch movement ahead. I crouch low and scan the area. The movement was a ways off, but large. A bear comes to mind, although it seems odd for it to be so close to the village. I move slowly through the under brush when I notice the tracks nearby. Examining them, they're from no beast that I know. They're large, long with claws, not the more circular print of a bear. The creature alternates between walking on it's hind legs and all fours. The front prints, more like large clawed hands. I reach a clearing and catch a brief glimpse of the large beast outpacing me in the distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales351A;What manner of beast stalks this village?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales353;I head out into the forest with my retainers. It's a grand day for partaking in a hunt. The forest seems to almost mirror the village with it's vibrant life. \n  A few hours later and I've come to begrudgingly appreciate the wildlife here. They're observant and quick. Often dashing to safety before we can strike. With some adjustments, we've fanned out, seeking now to perhaps flush something out and give us a wider firing arc on it. \n  Another hour later, we've found success. A fairly nice sized hare was flushed and as it was bounding my arrow struck true and brought it down. An exhilarating and difficult hunt, worthy of a fine rabbit stew with some wine tonight I do so believe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales353A;Perhaps I'll keep a foot for luck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales360;As is often the case, Belle is lost in a book and doesn't notice me enter the room. So I walk up beside her, lean over and whisper by her ear, "What're reading today?" With a yelp, Belle jumps and fumbles with her book for a second before securing it to her chest. Noticing me, her eyes seem to sparkle as she smiles. "It's great to see you again my [Root.GetLordLady]." \n  We sit down and she talks about the latest romantic novel she's reading. With a little blush, she mentions that ever since I gave her the "L'amour" book, that she's been reading romances more often than normal. \n  For a moment it seems like she's looking off at something in the distance, before turning to me and asking if I would walk with her so she could clear her head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales360A;Of course Belle, I would enjoy that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales361;It's a beautiful day for a walk, made all the greater by Belle's company. It isn't long though until I discover that she's some concerns. \n  "My [Root.GetLordLady], I'm very grateful for your attention, but I must ask... Why do you spend time visiting with me when you're already married? Not that you've any specific intentions towards me, it's more that I'm trying to figure out where my feelings are and I'm confused by your attention." \n  I look into Belle's beautiful eyes as they search mine. What is Belle to me? It's one that I haven't given much thought to in the grand scheme of things, yet I can see that I've a decision to make. I smile warmly and reply to Belle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales361A;My marriage is political, not one of love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales361B;My heart is large enough for you both.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales361C;I'm looking for a friend Belle, nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales365;It's a beautiful day for a walk, made all the greater by Belle's company. It isn't long though until I discover that she's some concerns. \n  "My [Root.GetLordLady], I'm very grateful for your attention, but I must ask... Why do you spend time visiting with me when I'm only a commoner, and you're a ruler who is so far above my station in society? Not that you've any specific intentions towards me, it's more that I'm trying to figure out where my feelings are and I'm confused by your attention." \n  I look into Belle's beautiful eyes as they search mine. What is Belle to me? It's one that I haven't given much thought to in the grand scheme of things, yet I can see that I've a decision to make. I smile warmly and reply to Belle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales365A;I will not let my feelings be restricted by station.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales365B;You should feel honored Belle, most commoners would.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales365C;I'm looking for a friend Belle, nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales367;I watch as Belles eyes tear up, while a smile that seems to shine greater than any other spreads across her face. "Thank you [Root.GetFirstName]. It is nice to know that my feelings may be felt by you as well." \n  Wiping her tears away, she hooks her arm through one of my own as we resume our walk and have a pleasant conversation about books, romance, the weather, being the daughter of a cobbler, and the headaches of being a ruler. The time passes too quickly as the sun begins to set. \n  I walk Belle back to her home, and wish her a pleasant evening. She looks about and noticing no one in view, leans forward and gives me a quick kiss. As she draws away, her cheeks burn red and with a smile, she darts inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales367A;Today was a good visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales368;I watch as Belles eyes tear up and her lip seems to quiver a bit. She turns brusquely from me and I hear her chastise herself. "I'm so foolish. Stupid Belle, life isn't a book." \n  I begin to say something when she looks at me again with a pained face. "I'm sorry, I cannot my [Root.GetLordLady]. I must go." \n  She then hurries off, her sobbing still audible as goes. With a sigh, I head back to my carriage. In retrospect I could see where that may not have been the best answer, yet something about her look prompted me to answer honestly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales368A;Well, today didn't end how I was expecting it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales369;I watch as a range of emotions cross Belle's face over the span of a moment, from sadness, to confusion, to embarrassment, and finally laughter. Belle begins laughing so hard that she doubles over slightly, and tears form. "Oh my. I suppose I do get carried away sometimes with my head in the clouds." \n  Looking at me and wiping away the tears while still smiling, Belle apologizes for the crazy thoughts that she had. We resume our walk, although for the next hour or so, Belle stammers out another apology for making things more than they where. It's a little entertaining, but I encourage her to not worry about it, that her company and friendship are more than enough to keep me visiting on occasion. \n  Soon, evening comes and with a smile and wave, she returns back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales369A;Today was a good visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales370;I've shared my experience hunting with a few others whom I trust. A couple weeks later, my Spy Master, [dw_my_spymaster.GetFirstName] approaches me with some information. \n  "My [Root.GetLordLady], I've made some inquiries, and I believe you should be made aware of what may be taking place." \n  [dw_my_spymaster.GetFirstName] proceeds to explain an old wives tale of a former ruler who's selfish ways resulted in his being cursed with the form of a massive beast. The township that he lorded over received the brunt of his anger, and apparently his continued existence requires a sacrifice every generation. After going through former powers that collapsed, [dw_my_spymaster.GetFirstName] believes that Belle's village may be the one from the legend, and I may have seen this beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales370A;I'll take a hunting party with me the next visit. Protect the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales370B;I'll have to ask Belle about this the next visit. Verify what we've heard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales370C;Bah. Curses and a Beast living off his land. Not buying it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales370D;This helps validate what Belle has already shared with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales380;I arrive to the town with some of the best hunters available in my realm. There is a murmur amongst the townsfolk as they observe our numbers and the quiet, focused demeanor of the hunters. Before any of the townsfolk can muster the nerve to speak up, we're gone. Moving into the forest in search of the Beast that plagues the village on my lands. \n  We make steady progress, and soon are able to pick up the trail of the Beast. I notice that some of the hunters obviously suspected it all a misunderstanding, and we'd likely spend the day chasing some uncommon animal. \n  The day draws on, and more than one hunter spots the figure in the distance. It seems to know we track it, and dusk draws near. The hunters look to me for guidance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales380A;We press on. The Beast shall fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales380B;We call it off, the approaching dusk is too dangerous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales381;I make the decision to press on. We redouble our efforts, balancing speed of pursuit with awareness of our surroundings to avoid an ambush. The Beast is spotted more often, and the gap narrows. \n  Finally, as dusk comes, we come upon what was once an impressive manor, which is now overgrown and in a heavy state of disrepair. On a balcony stands an impressive creature. "What fools have dared pursue me to my home? Leave, or face the wrath of he who rules these lands." \n  The hunters fan out, half focused on the Beast, the others looking for unseen dangers. I step forward and counter the Beast. "Your time has passed. I now rule these lands, and I shall free them from your curse." \n  The Beast lets out a low disturbing laugh. "Fool. The flesh of the villagers makes me immortal. You're all dead.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales381A;Hunters, fire at will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales381B;Immortality has its limits, face me and I shall show them to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales381C;Shit. Everyone, run, run for your lives!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales382;Arrows fly and the Beast roars as it leaps. I move and fire, my arrow finding home among the others that are sticking out from the Beast's hide. As it closes, the dogs are released. \n  The Beast is ferocious. It rends one dog in two, and tosses another against the ruined estate wall where it lands with a sickening thud. Arrows continue to fly, most finding their mark on the large Beast. It leaps, covering distance towards me with frightening ease. One of my men finds himself in the Beast's path and is soon left broken and bleeding. I fire again, my arrow striking true as it howls from losing an eye. \n  It leaps and swings. My bow is hewn in two as I use it to fend off his strike. Arrows continue to find their mark. His step falters and I pull my blade and swing. \n  He falls, bloodied at my feet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales382A;I finish the Beast, freeing the village.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales382B;I spare the Beast, as he's been brought to heel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales383;I bring my blade down, sinking it in deeply. It lashes out, still amazingly strong and easily splitting my leathers. The hunters cry out and another barrage of arrows fall upon the Beast. \n  It bellows with rage, and as it begins to lift itself, it chokes and vomits up blood. It twists its head, seeking me with it's one good eye. I lift myself from the ground and prepare to face it. I see it spasm, as though to leap, yet instead it collapses forward. It's bellow changes to frustration, it's rage begins to subside as life fades from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales383A;The Hunters have taken to calling me The Brave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales383B;I am thankful that the Beast's curse has come to an end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales384;I hold my blade high and challenge the Beast. "Why should a cursed thing such as you live?" \n  The Beast groans in defeat, his strength draining. "Stay your blade and I shall recover. Allow me to recover and I shall acknowledge your dynasty as my master for as long as it rules. I'm tied to these lands, yet I stray from them once a decade to feed and maintain my immortality. Grant me life, and I shall allow you to direct me and choose who I consume each decade." \n  I notice a couple of the hunters shift a little uncomfortably. Spare the Beast for a ferocious assassin that would strike once a decade and then retreat. Surfacing rarely enough to keep locating him difficult. Of course, is it right to use and contribute to the curse like this? After some thought, I make my decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales384A;You shall live, yet feed only at my direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales384B;I will not feed the curse. Kill the Beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales391;Word has reached me that [dw_beast_target.GetFullName] was killed in a most viscous fashion. Rumors are abound as to what kind of creature could have committed such an act, for the mutilation is so savage that people don't believe a normal man could have done such a deed. \n  Alas, while I may be aware, it is most prudent to keep such information to myself. Pity the foolish person who may draw my ire the next decade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales391A;The deed is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales393;What a disappointment. I've heard that [dw_beast_target.GetFullName] has been attacked by a large creature. Some are claiming it was a feral werewolf, while others swear it was a Beast from hell itself. \n  The downside is the Beast's initial attack wasn't a fatal one. Allowing [dw_beast_target.GetFirstName] to cry out for help and try to escape. \n  Although they lived, I understand the attack left them seriously maimed. A dangerous state with how easily disease spreads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales393A;May their injuries worsen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales395;I'm dismayed. I've learned that [dw_beast_target.GetFullName] lives, although they're wounded. But not only that, they somehow managed to alert guardsmen that were nearby, who managed to overwhelm and fatally injure the creature that attacked them. \n  While it's disappointing to lose a resource like that, the most annoying thing is the prestige that I understand [dw_beast_target.GetFirstName] has garnered due to their actions in the Beast's death. The only saving grace in all this, is they've no way to tie the Beast to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales395A;What a waste. Pitiful Beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales385;The Beast howls in defiance and leaps at me as I stride forth. The hunters wait nervously, not firing without the command being given. \n  The Beast hits the ground and bounds towards me, covering great distance as I let loose with an arrow that strikes true. I sidestep the Beast as I discard my bow and pull my sword. The Beast snarls as it turns and swings. I use my blade to turn the strike aside, and move to keep to the Beast's flank. \n  Our dance stretches on, with blood dripping from cuts on each of us, yet the Beast is the one worse for wear. As I continue to step to its side, his frustration comes through and with a snarl he spins and lunges. I see my chance and stand my ground as I brace my blade, allowing the Beast to impale himself upon it. His size takes me off my own feet, yet the deed is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales385A;The men have begun to call me the Curse Breaker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales385B;The men have begun to call me the Beast Slayer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales385C;I am victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales387;My body screams out that we're all in danger, so I call for the hunters to run for their lives. A few arrows fly, men turn, the dogs are released. \n  Chaos ensues as the Beast leaps down and into the throng of dogs. Whines and barks cut short fade into the distance as I run as fast as I can. Several minutes later, my lungs straining from moving as quickly as I could, I begin to feel safe enough to slow down. At least until I hear the screams of one of the hunters not to far away, as it's drowned out by the roar of the Beast. I urge my legs to continue to carry me, weaving through the woods in an attempt to reach safety. More screams reach my ears. If I continue on this path, I may be the only one to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales387A;I continue on, allowing their sacrifices to save me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales387B;I must attempt to save those who followed me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales388;I grit my teeth as I change course and head towards the sounds of a nearby hunter struggling for his life. I push back the fear that calls for me to flee and save myself. \n  Bursting through the undergrowth, I see the Beast. It has one of the hunters pinned, yet I notice the Beast itself is not without injury, be it arrows or small cuts. Without slowing, I pull my blade and leap at it. The Beast hears me, turns and seems too look through me with its yellow eyes. I begin to bring my blade down, at the same time it swings at me. \n  I'm struck, and tossed through the air and I crash into a tree. As I try to regain focus, I hear the Beast bellow in rage and pain. I see my blade on the ground, covered with blood, and the Beast is holding his face as it stumbles backwards before disappearing into the woods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales388A;Although injured, we survive for another day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales400;I stand before the forest. Thinking of the Beast, the screams of the dogs and hunters as they were cut down, and my vision blurs as my heart begins to beat so hard and fast that it seems to want to flee my chest. I find my mouth suddenly feels parched, and sweat falls from me as though it were rain. The trees seem taller, the shadows in them somehow darker. In the back of my mind, I see it's yellow eyes staring through me. \n  Fear. Fear has gripped me and has left me in no position to face the Beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales400A;With a sigh, I pack my things and return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales122;I enter the shop and Belle's father hops up excitedly. "My [Root.GetLordLady]! I was hoping you would stop by." With more energy than I'm used to seeing from the elderly cobbler, he rushes into the back and comes back out with a set of impressive footwear. \n  "I know it's an unworthy gift in light of how much you helped the village and especially my daughter, yet I'd like you to please have them. It's the least I can do for what you've done." \n  I accept the gift with a smile and nod of appreciation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales122A;Is Belle around today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales122B;Thank you for the footwear. Have a pleasant day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales410;With the Beast no longer a threat to the village, I decide to relax and do some game hunting. I decide to make my way along the outskirts before pushing deep into the forest. It's then that I hear some giggling. \n  Following it, I come upon a surprising site. The cobbler, Belle's elderly father, is chasing the barmaid around while she's coyly avoiding him. Or at least until she stops by a tree and he catches her. \n  I watch as with sweat dripping from his chase, he kisses and licks the base of her neck, causing her to giggle more. I watch as she pushes her ass against him, swaying it slightly to grind against his growing hard-on. With his free hand, he begins pulling up her dress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales410A;I should slip away and give them their privacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales410B;I'm well hidden, watching this may be the most game I see today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales411;After hiking up her dress, he drops his trousers, exposing an impressively thick dick. Lifting her leg while she braces on the tree, the cobbler prods the area around her pussy a few times before properly lining up and sinking in the tip. \n  She moans and bites her lip obviously working to take such girth. After a few small thrusts, the cobbler begins to slide it in deeper. Luckily, length wise he isn't more than average, as the barmaid seems light-headed and shaky by the time he buries it to the hilt. \n  Once all the way in, he begins to pick up the pace, causing her ample chest to sway and finally the spring free from the fabric trying to hold them in. His face beat red, the cobbler pumps away frantically, until he grunts and holds it in deep, while the barmaid nearly collapses as her knees give out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales411A;Way to go cobbler. Fill that little wench up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales282;I enter the bakery and am surrounded by the aroma of recently baked bread. The baker notices me and with a shout of excitement grabs a basket and proceeds to fill it to the brim with a batch of fresh warm buns. \n  "My [Root.GetLordLady]! I've heard the great news! Thank you so very much for lifting the curse that has plagued our village for generations. I only wish I could offer you more than these buns. Still, thank you very much and here, a basket so you can take some back to your home and enjoy them throughout the month.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales282A;Thank you for the warm buns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales292;I enter the lodge and am immediately greeted by cheers. The bartender calls out that drinks are on the house in recognition of my having brought an end to the Beast's reign of terror over the village. People quickly gather around and ask for me to recount the details as to how the Beast was defeated. \n  As the night stretches on new arrivals greet me and ask for the story to be repeated. By the third time through, some of the patrons in the lodge begin acting out various parts of the story. By the fifth telling, long loaves of hard bread are brandished, contributions from the baker, and are used as make shift weapons by those acting out my tale. By the seventh iteration, the patrons of the bar jump into action with a mix of song and narration, allowing me to relax and enjoy the show.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales292A;While not what I had in mind, it's still a very enjoyable evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales420;I find Belle reading like normal, although this time she notices me enter the room. A smile spreads across her face and I feel warmth within me for being the source of such a reaction from her. She closes the book and hops up and embraces me with a hug. Her body is soft, and she smells like a fresh spring morning. \n  "I was hoping I'd see you again my [Root.GetLordLady]. It's a beautiful day, would you like to join me for a walk?" \n  I find myself smiling in return to her smile. "I'd love to take a walk with a Beauty such as you my dear Belle." \n  Belle's cheeks redden from the compliment. She quickly grabs a small basket and hooks her hand through my arm before leading me outside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales420A;It seems as though she has something planned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales421;Belle is very lively today as she makes small talk as she leads me to a quiet spot by the stream that runs by the village.  We enjoy a fine picnic that she prepared. I inquire how she just so managed to have it prepared and she shares that she was getting the pattern down for how long would pass before I'd be able to visit. To make matters better, she even allows me to share several kisses with her. Her lips are such a perfect blend of soft and supple. \n  Alas, the mood shifts as she shares that she's nearing the time that she'll be claimed by the Beast. I urge her to join me in the court, but that only leads to tears as she says she dreams of being by my side, yet she can't in good conscience doom the village to the Beasts wrath. \n  After some thought, I share with Belle what my next step shall be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales421A;My court can provide me insight on dealing with this curse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales421B;I'll see what thoughts Gaston has on the Beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales421C;I shall lead a hunting party to slay the Beast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales421D;I shall ambush and slay the Beast when it comes for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales421E;Gaston and I shall track and slay the Beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales422;I've shared Belle's story with my Spy Master, [dw_my_spymaster.GetFirstName]. I instruct [dw_my_spymaster.GetHerHim] to obtain information on this curse discretely. After a month, [dw_my_spymaster.GetFirstName] meets with me to provide their report. \n  [dw_my_spymaster.GetFirstName] covers much of what Belle has, how it's a tale of an ages old ruler who's selfish ways resulted in his being cursed with the form of a massive beast. The township that he lorded over received the brunt of his anger, and apparently his continued existence requires a sacrifice every generation. The important information is that the Beast maintains its immortality by feeding on a select villager every generation. After consuming the sacrifice, the Beast's strength is at its peak. However, prior to its feeding, the Beast is at its weakest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales422A;I shall lead a hunting party to slay the Beast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales422B;I shall ambush and slay the Beast when it comes for Belle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales422C;Gaston and I shall track and slay the Beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales423;I seek out the most successful hunter of the village. After finding Gaston, I inquire about the Beast. Gaston's normal upbeat, arrogant demeanour changes, as though a dark cloud has passed overhead. \n  "I've seen this Beast you speak of. It's why I push myself to be the best hunter there ever was. It's said to be immortal, yet my father shared a tale of how he saw the Beast wounded and weak after an attack. My father died trying to free the village of this curse, yet he was only half the hunter that I am today. If you wish to see this curse ended, then it would be best that we do it together." \n  While a braggart, everything I've seen or heard seems to indicate that Gaston is indeed a capable hunter. The only question is do I handle this alone or with him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales423A;Gaston and I shall track and slay the Beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales423B;Gaston, join my court and help me slay the Beast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales423C;I shall ambush and slay the Beast when it comes for Belle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales425;Belle is very lively today as she makes small talk as she leads me to a quiet spot by the stream that runs by the village.  We enjoy a fine picnic that she prepared,and share several kisses. Her lips are such a perfect blend of soft and supple. \n  Alas, the mood shifts as soon as I bring up her joining me in my court. As tears begin to flow, she shares that she's nearing the time that she'll be claimed by some kind of fabled Beast. This small serene village is apparently locked in a hellish curse, where a Beast identifies a sacrifice from each generation. If Belle attempts to escape her fate, the Beast would ravage the town, killing ten villagers to sate its hunger and teach the village a lesson. And the good hearted Belle cannot allow that. \n  After some thought, I share with Belle what my next step shall be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales425A;My court can provide me insight on dealing with this curse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales425B;Gaston knows these woods, I'll consult him on slaying the Beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales425C;I shall lead a hunting party to slay the Beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales425D;I shall ambush and slay the Beast when it comes for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales429;Belle is very lively today as she makes small talk as she leads me to a quiet spot by the stream that runs by the village.  We enjoy a fine picnic that she prepared,and share several kisses. Her lips are such a perfect blend of soft and supple. \n  Soon we're under a tree, relaxing in the shade and discussing how things will be in the future now that the village is no longer threatened by the Beast and its curse. It isn't long before Belle leaving her home and joining me in court comes up. I'm glad to hear that Belle welcomes such an decision, and that she would follow me back today if I so desire. \n  So after some thought, I respond to Belle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales429A;Come with me now. Join me in my court, my love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales429B;Next time we meet, I aim to bring you back with me to my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales440;Gaston and I head into the forest, intent on bring an end to the curse by slaying the Beast. After a couple miles from the village, Gaston brings to my attention some tracks that he says are the Beast. In looking at them, I can only support Gaston's assessment. \n  After a little over an hour, we catch sight of something large off in the distance. The first thought is that perhaps it's a bear, yet as we watch it, we're quickly certain that it's our quarry. Gaston's eyes flash determination and he moves forward, picking up the pace. I follow along, keeping my eyes to the surroundings while allowing Gaston to bloodhound the Beast. \n  Soon we find ourselves in an overgrown courtyard, with a large ruined manor before us. Gaston looks at me with a wild fire in his eye. "Who takes point my [Root.GetLordLady]?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales440A;I'll take the lead Gaston.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales440B;Lead on Gaston, I've your back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales441;We enter the old manor with me in the lead. Standing before us at the top of a curved stairwell is the Beast. "Grrr, fools! You who have entered my lands without my permissions shall be killed and used to stock my kitchen cabinets." \n  I stride forward to the base of the stairwell and proclaim, "Vile Beast, these lands that you hunt upon are no longer yours. I'm the new ruler and I'll see the curse end here this day!" Brandishing my blade, I prepare for the Beast. \n  With inhuman speed, the Beast lunges and is upon me, it's claws seeking to rip my head from my body. I barely manage to parry the initial blow and my arms ache from the force of the strike. I must act quickly, and I make my decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales441A;I am capable enough to strike down the Beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales441B;I attempt to hold the Beast at bay to give Gaston a shot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales441C;I shall attempt to fall back behind Gaston.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales442;The Beast may have had the initial strike, yet the final one shall be mine. I give a shout of defiance and push towards the Beast, bringing my blade upward in an arc that causes it to leap backward and right into the path of one of Gaston's arrows. The Beast bellows with rage and I press forward, swinging my blade towards the neck of the Beast. It goes to retreat again, and meets an arrow of Gaston's. \n  With it realizing retreating will expose it to Gaston's dangerous arrows, it stands to face me. I bring my blade down at at angle and the Beast raises its massive forearm to receive the blow. My blade sinks to bone, while the Beast roars and strikes at me. It's claws tear through my armor. I ignore the wound and lunge, putting my weight behind the blow as my strike hits true, bringing the Beast down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales442A;The Beast is slain and Gaston has taken to calling me the Beast Slayer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales442B;The Beast is slain and Gaston has taken to calling me the Curse Breaker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales442C;The Beast is slain, the curse is no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales443;I ignore the pain in my arms as I bring my blade up again. The Beast roars and strikes again, almost knocking the blade from my numbing arms. The Beast roars as an arrow from Gaston sinks into its chest. The Beast's gaze falls upon Gaston and it attempts to bat me to the side. I brace and absorb the blow with my body, feeling bones and muscle cry out, yet I maintain my spot between them. I'm rewarded by another arrow striking the Beast. \n  The Beast's yellow eyes turn red with fury. Blows rain down upon me and do my best to turn them away or mitigate the damage while not allowing it to pass. \n  After what seems like an eternity, my grasp finally falters and my blade falls. I brace for the strike, yet none comes. I look up and see an arrow sunk in the eye of the Beast, and it falls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales443A;I survived... the Beast is dead, great shot Gaston.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales444;I realize that being the point against the inhuman onslaught of the Beast will leave me a dead man, and as such I begin back-pedalling, trying to change places with Gaston who is presently sinking arrows into the Beast. I catch movement out of the corner of my eye, and turn to see that Gaston has moved to the side to give him a better angle. \n  Unfortunately, the Beast takes the opening caused by my change of focus. I hear my blade clatter on the ground, while I'm wondering how it is that I'm looking down on the Beast. As I crash into the ground, I realize that my change of perspective was from being thrown. I've blood in my mouth, and my limbs aren't wanting to respond. \n  I hear Gaston and the Beast cry out at each other. After some time, there is only silence. "We... we've defeated it my [Root.GetLordLady].";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales444A;The Beast is dead, yet Gaston and I aren't much better off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales445;We enter the old manor with Gaston in the lead. Standing before us at the top of a curved stairwell is the Beast. "Grrr, fools! You who have entered my lands without my permissions shall be killed and used to stock my kitchen cabinets." \n  Gaston cackles like a wild man and dashes forward, firing an arrow before discarding his bow and drawing his blade. I level my bow and take aim at the Beast as I watch it avoid my first shot as it moves with inhuman speed. The Beast lunges and clashes with Gaston, pushing him backwards and almost knocking the blade from his hand. I see surprise on Gaston's face from the might of the Beast's blow, yet he brings his blade around and squares off. \n  I must act quickly, and I make my decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales445A;I shall steady my aim and take the Beast's eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales445B;I do my best to support Gaston as he makes his stand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales445C;I've made a mistake. I flee while Gaston has the Beast distracted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales446;The Beast and Gaston enter a dance of death, each striking, parrying, countering, and moving about. The Beast clearly has the strength and speed to compensate for the skill that Gaston is displaying. Meaning it'll likely come down to stamina, and if the Beast is also inhuman in that regards, then it doesn't bode well for Gaston. \n  At least it wouldn't if I wasn't here. Finally seeing the opening, I let loose. The arrow flies and strikes true, sinking into the Beast's eye. It howls and begins lashing about frantically. Gaston is doing his best to keep to the blinded side while avoiding the rage fuelled swings. \n  Gaston ends up cornered and The Beast charges Gaston as I let loose again. Once more, my aim prevails, with the second arrow hitting true. It crashes at Gaston's feet... the Beast is dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales446A;The Beast is slain and Gaston has taken to calling me the Beast Slayer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales446B;The Beast is slain and Gaston has taken to calling me the Curse Breaker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales446C;The Beast is slain, the curse is no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales447;The Beast and Gaston enter a dance of death, each striking, parrying, countering, and moving about. The Beast clearly has the strength and speed to compensate for the skill that Gaston is displaying. Leaving me as the difference maker as I use every gap to fire an arrow towards the Beast. \n  Many of my arrows hit the mark, limiting the movement of the Beast. Both the Beast and Gaston are bleeding, yet the flow of battle is clearly in our favor. Another of my arrows hits home and Gaston charges the Beast. The Beast stumbles slightly, showing its weakened state, and Gaston's blade sinks deep. The Beast howls and strikes Gaston, knocking him away and leaving his blade in the Beast's chest. \n  With the gap, I let fly more arrows. The Beast stumbles, and falls, driving Gaston's blade deeper. Ending its life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales447A;The Beast is slain, Gaston is wounded, but should be fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales448;I notice I've frozen after seeing the Beast so easily able to avoid my first arrow. Gaston is hard pressed, and looks like he's snapped. I believe it's only a matter of time before the Beast finishes him and comes for me. Leaving me precious little time to get moving. Dropping what I can to reduce my carry weight, I flee as fast as my legs can take me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales448A;I run, leaving the howls and screams behind me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales449;I've made it back to my horse at the village, and am now riding as quickly as I can back to my estate when I find myself tumbling painfully along the road. As I try to pick myself up, I cough up a lot of blood. My limbs aren't responding how I want them to, leaving me little more than a twitching mess. \n  "No one leaves Gaston behind. No one betrays Gaston. No one..." I see the severely wounded Gaston standing at the road side. At his waist looks to be one of the horns of the Beast, claimed as a prize. I try to offer thanks, to offer a reward for his actions, but I'm unable to do much more than gurgle. \n  I then watch as he pulls back another arrow, and without a word, he lets loose, and my world turns black...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales449A;No one kills cowards like Gaston can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales430;I reach the village, only to find a distraught cobbler as he explains that the Beast had just departed minutes ago with Belle, his daughter. Knowing I've not a lot of time to waste, I head off in the direction the cobbler points towards. \n  The trail is easy enough to track as I come across the remains of Belle's clothing as it appears it is being ripped off her bit by bit. I check each piece quickly for blood, yet so far see none. I press on and after a little over a mile, I hear Belle's voice and another, deep gravely baritone voice respond. \n  As I get closer I can hear her begging, while the Beast says something about just having a little fun before consuming her and revitalizing himself for another generation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales430A;I'll sneak up and prepare to strike!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales431;I peer through the under-brush and am shocked to see a naked Belle being pinned down by the Beast. It's penis growing thick and long as it describes how it'll pleasure itself with her body before feasting on her flesh. I watch has it aligns itself and plunges in, grasping her hips and fucking her without a care to her condition or feelings. \n  I use this time while it is distracted to circle towards its back, and I hear it growl in satisfaction about Belle's being a virgin, thankful that it was able to deflower her. Belle meanwhile is crying as she's being ravaged. \n  I'm finally in position, behind the Beast where I can see it pumping away, it's cock driving into Belle, oblivious to her pain and the blood that flows from her ruptured hymen. Grasping my blade, I realize it's time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales431A;I must strike now and end the Beast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales432;I slip out from my spot and rush the rear of the Beast. It's lost in the moment as it's fucking and taunting Belle. \n  Covering the distance, I leap and lift the blade high. As I descend, I bring the blade down towards the base of the Beast's neck. The blade, assisted by my momentum and weight, strikes soundly. And with a sickening crack of cleaved bone, it's head is separated from its body. \n  Once I land, I quickly recover and roll the bulk of the Beast's headless body off of Belle. Belle's tears are a mix of horror, joy, and embarrassment. I kneel down, taking off my travelling cloak and use it to cover her. \n  I hold her close, and rock her back and forth while whispering that it's over. The Beast is no more, and she and the village is finally safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales432A;The villagers have taken to calling me the Beast Slayer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales432B;The villagers have taken to calling me the Curse Breaker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales432C;The Beast is slain, the curse is no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales450;I don't find Belle in her room like normal, yet when I look out her window, I see her sitting under a tree in bloom, enjoying a book as normal, while wearing a beautiful yellow gown. I head out of the back of the cobbler's home and the creak made by the door draws her attention to me. She smiles a radiant smile and stands to meet me. \n  I compliment her dress and learn that it was her mothers for when she attended balls with her father, a long time ago. She blushes a bit and shares that she wears it in hope of someday standing by you at court with it on. \n  I ask if her father knows, and Belle shares that he knew the moment she first asked if she could have her mother's dress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales450A;Soon Belle. I'll find a way to free you from the Beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales450B;If you're ready, then so to am I.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales451;The curse of the Beast still looming over Belle is the only obstacle to our happiness. She presses me for details of past attempts, yet I counter by mentioning how beautiful she is and how she is worth all of the challenges. \n  I know that attempting the same method twice can prove futile, so I may need to look at another approach for dealing with the Beast. I notice Belle's concern is growing, so I put on an air of confidence and share that I've a plan to deal with the Beast. And that the next time I see her, it'll be to bring her back to court with me. \n  I've made my decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales455;We take stroll around town, visiting people and giving Belle the opportunity to say goodbye. It's impressive to see how people handle both joy for Belle's new life, and pain for the loss of such a friendly face that they could rely on. \n  Even the triplets, who I understand were a little antagonistic towards Belle on occasion break down into tears, wishing her happiness. When I mutter how impressed I am, Belle whispers that they're more likely heartbroken that it isn't they who are joining me. Then she flashes me a smile that shines both of her feelings for me, and her victory in coming out on top of them. \n  The rest of the goodbyes are much less catty, but still filled with emotion. By the time we're done, Belle's doe eyes are a little red from her tears, but she kisses me and says she is finally ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales455A;It is time my love, let us depart for your new home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales460;I find Belle deeply engrossed with a book. I recall from the title that it's a rather explicit novel and face is flush with lust, while she sits with her legs spread and almost absent mindedly rubs her pussy through her panties. I enjoy the site for a bit before Belle's gaze turns to me, still filled with lust until the realization that I'm standing before her kicks in. \n  "Ah, my [Root.GetLordLady]! I didn't hear you come in." As she quickly adjusts her clothing to be less revealing, I make a point to step forward and watch her intently. When she's done, her cheeks are still red and she's having difficulty meeting my eyes. \n  "Did you enjoy the book I gave you?" \n  "Yes" \n  "Have you tried any of the positions?" \n  Belle hesitates for just a moment as her cheeks redden, "no.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales460A;Let's go for a walk Belle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales461;As we walk, I ask Belle why she hasn't tried any of the positions. I learn that outside of her reading habits turning towards the carnal instead of romantic side of things, along with an increase in her masturbating, that Belle is still a virgin. \n  Through asking questions, I find that overall, Belle seems to have a natural subservient demeanor. Answering just about anything I ask, as long as it's asked with a measure of authority. This of course makes me wonder why she hasn't been taken advantage of by now, so I ask. \n  She shares that none in the village bother her in such a way, as she's been selected to be given to the Beast, a cursed creature that demands sacrifice once a generation or it devastates the entire village.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales461A;If the Beast is to have you, enjoy what you can, while you can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales461B;Fear not Belle, for you're mine, and no Beast shall take you from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales463;As we walk, I ask Belle why she hasn't tried any of the positions. I learn that outside of her reading habits turning towards the carnal instead of romantic side of things, along with an increase in her masturbating, that Belle is still inexperienced sexually. \n  Through asking questions, I find that overall, Belle seems to have a natural subservient demeanor. Answering just about anything I ask, as long as it's asked with a measure of authority. I wonder briefly why she hasn't been taken advantage of by now, leaving the only obvious answer as the villagers not wanting to trigger the wrath of the Beast by messing with his selected sacrifice. \n  I put forth my assumption, and she confirms that she came to the same conclusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales465;Belle seems a little more upbeat at my bold proclamation and asks what exactly I mean. I explain that Belle is a young, beautiful woman, and that for her to give in to her role to be sacrificed without allowing herself to enjoy the ecstasy of sex, benefits no one. In fact, that it could even be argued that by giving into one's carnal nature can lead to feelings of accomplishment and being able to meet one's end with no regrets. \n  Belle's eyes tear up a bit as she weighs the words, and then she surprises me with a kiss that is filled with passion. Breaking away she thanks me profusely before giving a curtsy and hurrying off back to her home. \n  Noticing the sun setting, I decide it's time for me to return home as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales465A;I look forward to seeing how Belle adapts to the new concept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales467;Belle seems a little more upbeat at my bold proclamation and asks what exactly I mean. I make it clear that I desire her, and that I shall let no man, woman, or Beast stand in my way from having her by my side. \n  Belle's eyes begin to tear up as she hugs me tightly while thanking me. I return her surprise hug, although I run my hands down her back until one rests on each ass cheek. She looks up at me, her cheeks flushed, and I kiss her deeply. While kissing her, I cup her ass, and pull her into my body, giving her a hug filled with passion. As we break our embrace, her eyes are sultry and lust filled. \n  "I must return Belle, but remember what I said. You are mine, and I shall not tolerate anyone getting in the way.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales467A;I bid her a good evening as I return back to my home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales470;I don't see Belle in the little sitting room, but I hear her in a nearby room. I open the door slightly and see Belle lying on her back, a book by her side as she is wearing fine lingerie, and exploring her body. I watch as she pulls on some panties, and how she's pulling them tight and slow against her legs as they slide down. All intended to increase the sensation as they glide along her pale flesh. \n  I step into the room and she freezes for a moment, before I motion for her to continue. She does so, and I notice her face flush as I stand there and watch. She asks if she should get completely dressed and I motion for her to continue. For while she's a delicate treat, I've time before needing to sate my hunger. \n  After she's dressed, I share with her the news of how I shall handle the Beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales470A;I shall bring you to my court, away from these lands and the Beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales470B;Gaston knows these woods, I'll enlist his aid in slaying the Beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales470C;I shall lead a hunting party to slay the Beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales470D;I shall ambush and slay the Beast when it comes for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales471;Belle gasps and begins stammering about her father and the others in the village who would be at risk should she leave and join me in my court. Belle then does the unthinkable and declines my offer. \n  I fix her with a stern gaze and while she doesn't retract her statement, she isn't able to look me in the eyes. \n  I think over my options. Bringing her to my court against her will isn't difficult, as I can simply have her taken from here. Sure the village may suffer, but it is the easiest, and likely safest route to get that which I desire. Or I suppose I could risk myself or others in trying to bring the Beast down directly. \n  After thinking it over a moment, I make my decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales471A;You come with me, even if I have to drag you away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales473;I made arrangements the following day for Belle to be bound and taken from the village. I sent a patrol with the wagon to ensure that no one is foolish enough to interfere. \n  Before morning, I was presented with a bound Belle. Tears streamed down her cheeks as she was helpless before me. I stroke her hair as I bend down to get face to face. \n  "My dearest, beautiful Belle. You are mine. Your village, your father, and even the Beast, put them all out of your mind. They're nothing to you now. You exist solely to meet my needs, and henceforth you shall be my lover." I give her a soft kiss on her forehead and ask if she understands. With eyes that shine with both hope and pain, she nods in agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales473A;Welcome to my court, my lovely Belle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales480;I walk into the normally empty Cobbler shop and wait a moment, expecting the cobbler or Belle to appear any moment. It's then that I hear a curious moan and sound. \n  I follow the sounds into the back, and find an interesting site as Belle's father is in a daze and panting, his stomach and Belle's feet covered in cum. Belle's face is flushed with lust as she's frantically fingering herself, while still rubbing her feet on her father's shrinking, spent penis. \n  I enter the room and Belle's father snaps out of his daze. He begins to stammer and I dismiss him with a wave, ignoring him as he frantically gathers his clothes and leaves the room. Belle meanwhile is still flush with lust, not having cum herself. I smile at Belle, please with her having given into her inner desires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales480A;Fear not, I shall join you Belle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales481;I undress while Belle continues to pleasure herself on the bed. My cock springs free and stiffens as I watch Belle pull her cum covered foot up to her mouth, where she then licks off her father's spunk. \n  I push her legs back onto her chest, so her pussy comes up to face me. She grips my cock and moans as she rubs it against her pussy. She's slick, covered with her juices and my cock throbs with desire to be inside her. She guides my cock to her hole and I let my weight ease it in. She's extremely tight, and so aroused that Belle spasms as a minor orgasm ripples through her. I slowly begin to fuck her, sliding in a bit before backing out, and then taking it a bit deeper with the next thrust. \n  I increase my pace, seeking my own relief as Belle looks up at me and begs, "Please, fill me with your love.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales481A;I comply as I orgasm, filling Belle as I cum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales483;I undress while Belle retrieves some 'toys' that she said she's ordered since I was last here. An interesting assortment, to be certain. I take the lease and collar and put it on Belle. Her eyes, large and doe like, staring at me as I ensure it's snug. I have her crawl around on all fours for a bit, smacking her naked ass and chastising her for her act with her father. \n  She's shaking with desire when I bind her arms and push her onto the bed. I pull on the dual phallic girdle and kneel between Belle's legs. "Please my lady, use me," she begs. I rub both phalluses along her pussy, covering them in her juices. Pushing her legs up, I line them both up, one to a hole as I begin to enter her. Belle trembles as I ease in, and finally begin fucking her. When she cums, it's so hard that she actually squirts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales483A;You are such a good little slut Belle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales123;I make my way over to the Cobbler's. I enter and find Belle's father working away at his trade, with a variety of well made shoes around the shop. \n  I clear my throat and the old cobbler looks up almost startled. His face flushes red as he likely recalls my walking in on him as his daughter pleasured him. "Good day! Welcome to my shop. Are you looking for some reliable footwear?" \n  I return his smile and say...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales123B;Is that little slutty daughter of yours around?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales490;As I open the door to the back, I immediately hear sounds of Belle in ecstasy. I look over at her father, and he does his best to not notice and be interested on straightening shoes on display. \n  I follow the words of 'oh god' and 'it feels so good in my ass' to find Belle laying on her bed, feverishly pounding her fingers into her pussy, while a thick, lit candle is buried in her ass. Upon entering the room, Belle sees me and with lust filled eyes she continues to pound away, giving no regard to my presence. I move to where I have a great view and watch as Belle shutters in an intense orgasm, cumming so hard that she squirts. \n  "I applaud your embracing your sexuality Belle. Alas, I've come to speak with you about my plans regarding handling the Beast.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales490A;I care nothing about the Beast and shall bring Belle to my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales490B;I convince Belle to seduce the Beast, so I can capture it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales490C;I shall enlist the aid of the hunter Gaston in slaying the Beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales490D;I shall ambush and slay the Beast when it comes for Belle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales500;I arrive to the town with some of the best trackers available in my realm. There is a murmur amongst the townsfolk as Belle meets with us, and we prepare to venture forth into the forest in search of the Beast's lair.  \n  We make steady progress, and soon are able to pick up the trail of the Beast shortly after noon. The day draws on, and more than one tracker spots the figure in the distance. Finally, as dusk comes, we come upon what was once an impressive manor, which is now overgrown and in a heavy state of disrepair. \n  I motion for the men to bind and strong Belle up. She looks beautiful in her mother's yellow gown. I can also see that being bound, and vulnerable is also exciting her. \n  Bound, the men withdraw and move to the bushes. There is a roar from inside the manor, and I hear it approach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales500A;Now we wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales501;The Beast lumbers out and roars, I brace and hold my breath, thankful that none of the men have fled from the sight. Belle herself doesn't scream, yet she does almost collapse, her bound hands being all that holds her upright. The Beast drops on all fours as it approaches her and demands to know why she's here. Belle responds meekly, sharing that I brought her here to fulfil the offering. \n  The Beast circles around her, growling, and although she's trembling, I can see that Belle is also aroused. A fact that the Beast also notices as it proclaims, "I can smell you female. You're like a dog in heat aren't you?" \n  With a clawed hand, it tears away her gown, exposing her. After tearing away her clothing, it stands and pulls her close, pushing its large member up against her as it seeks her pussy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales501A;Be ready, the time to move approaches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales502;The Beast finally finds her hole, and forcefully drives itself in. It's hips moving with animal instinct as it seeks to sate its lust with little regard for Belle herself. Luckily her arousal and recent sexual awakening appear to be allowing her to manage not completely breaking from the bestial onslaught. \n  The Beast is lost in it's desires, hips humping as quickly as possible while Belle moans in pleasure. My men and I move out from where we were hiding, and move to encircle them. The Beast notices too late, and like a rutting dog, it's so caught in the moment that it can do little more than growl a warning at us as it pounds away at Belle. \n  Belle manages to beg for it to fill her, and the Beast appears to comply, roaring as it fills her cunt. Alas, we're already in position, and the Beast is surrounded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales502A;We have you surrounded, surrender or perish Beast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales503;The Beast growls as it looks around it. Surprisingly, it's still holding Belle as though to shield her. I introduce myself, making it known that I am the ruler of these lands that he hunts, and that his reign is to come to an end as it stands. \n  I offer it two choices. First is to perish at our hand, where it's head shall later be mounted over the mantle at the village inn. Second is cease it's present torment of the village, swear fealty to me, and answer my call at least once a decade, should I give it. \n  The Beast looks down at Belle in its hands, and asks if it can keep her if it agrees to swear fealty to me. I consider my plans for Belle and respond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales503A;Belle will be coming to my court. Although you may visit her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales503B;You may keep the little slut, consider her my gift to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales503C;Never mind, you're too troublesome. Men, kill the Beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales511;I visit with Beauty and the Beast. It's a pleasant visit, void of any real action or cool event, as this is just a place holder for the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales511A;After a nice little visit I return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales124;I make my way over to the Cobbler's. I enter and find Belle's father working away at his trade, with a variety of well made shoes around the shop. \n  I clear my throat and the old cobbler looks up almost startled. He grins widely and makes a comment about how much Belle speaks of me, before asking if I'm here for Belle or new footwear. \n  I could have Belle join me in court, or I could just visit to see what she's up to. Of course, since I've awoken her sexuality, I risk her straying with others should I not bring her to court. I return his smile and say...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales124A;I'm here to bring Belle to my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales124B;I'm just here to see what the little vixen is up to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales521;The cobbler says that Belle is back in her room, so I go to find her. I hear her humming to herself as I open the door and a shocked Belle lets out a little shriek as she tries her best to cover herself. \n  After seeing it's me, Belle calms, and blushing, hides the dress behind her, giving me a clear view of her naked beauty. I inquire as to why she's embarrassed. \n  "This is one of my mother's gowns. It's one that she wore to the first ball that father took her too. I pull it out sometimes and imagine wearing it in your court, and wondering how it would feel to be seen in it." I nod in understanding and then assure her that with beauty such as hers in the court, that half would be jealous, while the other half would be interest in what's under the dress. As to the issue of coming to court...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales521A;The time is right dearest Belle, join me in my court as my lover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales521B;The time isn't right yet. I'm just here to visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2000;While I'm out enjoying a ride through the countryside, I decide to take a different route than normal as I'm in the mood for a change of scenery. \n  The air is fresh and the scenery relaxing. I find my mind wandering on things of little importance, which is a welcome break from the rigors of ruling. It's shortly afterwards that I believe I hear a young woman's cry for assistance. \n  I bring myself back to the present and look around. I don't see anyone, however, there is a rather impressive tree, with what appears to be an oversized rabbit hole nestled among its roots. \n  I hear the call for help again, and it sounds like it's coming from the hole itself. Upon approaching I call out to ask who the young woman is. \n  "My name is Alice, and I appear to be stuck in this rabbit hole. Could you please help?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2000A;Hold on! I'll help pull you out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2000B;Ha! Nice trick. I'll not fall prey to being trapped myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2009;I ride off, and after a few moments of silence, I hear the cry for help resume. As I ride off, I hear the voice fade. \n  Sure, it may have been a damsel in distress, but it could also have been a trap. Or perhaps some kind of twisted plot that would have opened my court to potential oddities that would have become more headache than entertainment. \n  Either way, what's done is done. Perhaps I may pass the hole again some day, but for today, the hole and the person within it can stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2009A;If I see it again, perhaps I'll change my approach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2010;I get down and approach the hole. Peeking in I see a young woman who appears to be struggling as she's wedged in a hole that stretches into darkness. \n  "Oh please, I've climbed this far and am too tire to continue. Please, a hand if you will?" \n  I brace myself and reach down into the hole, stretching to where I'm having second thoughts as I feel my hold begin to slip. Then she grasps my hand, and with a grunt, I begin to pull as hard as I can. \n  After several long minutes, I get her up over the edge, and out of the hole. We both spend a moment catching our breath before I inquire as to how she got stuck down there. She responds with a story that seems a bit fantastical, but the end result being she's lost and if half of what she said is true, she may have escaped a fairy realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2010A;You poor thing, come and join my court. You're safe now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2010B;This is too insane. You're free, now begone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2005;I get down and approach the hole. Peeking in I see a young woman who appears to be struggling as she's wedged in a hole that stretches into darkness. \n  "Oh please, I've climbed this far and am too tire to continue. Please, a hand if you will?" \n  I brace myself and reach down into the hole, stretching to where I'm having second thoughts as I feel my hold begin to slip. Then she grasps my hand, and with a grunt, I begin to pull as hard as I can. \n  After several long minutes, I can tell immediately that this is a bad idea, as my grip begins to slip. I'm just not strong enough with such limited leverage. \n  I apologize as I let go of Alice's hand. She gasps as she falls, and I'm amazed at just how large the hole suddenly seems. \n  "Oh deary me, not again." She mutters before disappearing from view.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2005A;Well hell. Perhaps if I were just a bit stronger I could have done it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2020;Some commotion and shouting catches my attention as I turn towards the chamber entrance. A guard ducks into the room, barely avoiding a hurled object. "Ah, a-announcing her majesty, the Queen of Hearts!" \n  I raise an eyebrow out of interest as a short woman, with a disproportionally large head enters the room. Her stature aside, she clearly carries herself with regal bearing. She approaches me and gives the slightest curtsy. "Am I to understand that you're the ruler of these lands?" \n  I answer, and follow-up with a question of my own, since I've never heard of such a title outside of playing cards. She shares that she's been displaced. That she somehow stumbled through a rabbit hole and ended up here, in these lands. \n  I mention Alice's name, and the queen shares that she knows of the young woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2020A;Please consider staying, I welcome someone of your lineage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2020B;Guards, OFF WITH HER HEAD! (Queen not added to the game);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2020C;Guards, take the 'Queen' and toss her out of my lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2030;The Queen of Hearts manages to catch me alone, and I'm a little stunned by her normally rigid bearing suddenly becoming... different as she sways her body about in a way that I'm guessing is meant to be seductive. \n  "Ah, there you are. I've been watching you and I've determined that you're in need of a good woman. One who's mind, body and social stature is befitting, and since there are no better candidates than myself, I shall be willing to become your lover." \n  She looks up at me, her eyes searching mine for an answer. She seems somewhat vulnerable right now, a side that she hasn't shown up until now. After some consideration, I give her my answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2030A;Marry me, let's not waste our time on ideal time spent as lovers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2030B;Yes, I've been hoping to take you on as a lover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2030C;Um, no. I'll pass. We should keep our relationship professional.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2035;The Queen of Hearts manages to catch me alone, and I'm a little stunned by her normally rigid bearing suddenly becoming... different as she sways her body about in a way that I'm guessing is meant to be seductive. \n  "Ah, there you are. I've been watching you and I've determined that you're a man who has room for another good woman. One who's mind, body and social stature is befitting of you, which leaves no better candidates than myself. While I'd prefer to be your spouse, I shall be willing to become your lover instead." \n  She looks up at me, her eyes searching mine for an answer. She seems somewhat vulnerable right now, a side that she hasn't shown up until now. After some consideration, I give her my answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2035A;Of course! I shall let no marriage impede an affair with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2035B;No thank you. It would be wrong to have an affair while I'm married.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2037;Later that evening, I enter my study and find the Queen of Hearts naked as she's lounging on a chair. She grabs her breasts and gives them a good squeeze. "Not to bad, wouldn't you agree my love?" \n  I find my gaze locked on her breasts, and the way she kneads them almost mesmerizing as I approach. "They're befitting one of your stature my Queen." She blushes, her pale skin unable to hide her appreciation of the compliment. \n  Before I know it, I'm making love to her. While that wasn't my intention upon entering the chamber, but as I got closer, something about her made her seem vulnerable, and I just couldn't stop myself. As she shudders from another orgasm, I feel myself reaching my peak as well. She looks at me with her large eyes as I get ready to climax.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2037A;I bury my cock deep within her and fill her royal womb with my seed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2037B;I've no desire to risk impregnating her so I pull out before I blow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales2037C;Her eyes seem to yearn for me to cum hard, and I don't disappoint her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales3000;I sit down and ensure that I'm alone. Running my hand along the lamp, I feel the warmth within it. With the heel of my palm, I rub the lamp, feeling the warmth build until suddenly - WHOOSH - a billowing bluish cloud of smoke flows from the spout and solidifies into an impressive blue skinned genie.\n  "I shall grant you three wishes, not more. Your wishes also must be unique from each other. So if you wish for immense wealth, you'll receive it, once. So what will it be? Fame, fortune, something else?"\n  "You have made [genie_wishes_made] wishes so far.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales3000A;I just wanted to talk for a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales3000B;I wish for your freedom Genie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales3000C;I wish for Jasmine's freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales3000D;I wish for immense wealth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWFairyTales3000E;I wish to be famous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
