DWTentacle10;My childhood was a mix of emotion. My mother was raped by some kind of abomination. My birth and early years had people observing and testing me, to ensure I wasn't corrupted. Unknown to those fools, something inside me knew that my life depended on hiding my true self. \n  It wasn't until adulthood, through the ravages of puberty that my inner power rose to the surface and altered my features. By then, it was too late to simply dispose of me. I had already cultivated enough support and power that they had to give me the benefit of the doubt. To give me a chance. \n  The fools. I've played the game, and now I sit upon my own throne. Mankind is a fearful species though, and as such I still have many who plot against me. \n  But this game of survival isn't new. What is new is what I've planned for them all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWTentacle10A;My existence is not a mistake. It is this world's solution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWTentacle1000;[dw_mind_fuck_target.GetBestName] is in need of being brought to heel. Of the myriad of options available to me, one stands out as the most desirable solution to this equation. It is time to mind fuck [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName]. \n  I shudder in anticipation and hunger as I can clearly imagine my tentacle sliding into the various entryways to [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName]'s skull. I chuckle at the thought of the drool that falls from their slackened jaw as I both assail their mind with my mental dominance, while my tentacles push through the soft tissue until reaching their brain. Where upon reaching the brain, my tentacles will burrow in, carving and absorbing their delicate cerebral flesh. \n  Oh how I do hope it isn't a mind that's failing, for those lack in taste. While a sharp mind is a blissful delicacy to consume. \n  Of course, I'm not seeking to consume their mind completely. No, that would result in death, and death is too kind a release for what I have in store for them. No, [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName] just needs to be shaped a bit. Molded into less of an obstacle for me. Where it can then stand as an example of what can happen to those that oppose me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWTentacle1000A;[dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName] is behind bars and helpless to escape my attempt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWTentacle1000B;[dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName] is a slave who is cannot resist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWTentacle1000C;I shall strike [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName] from the shadows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWTentacle1000D;I shall overpower [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWTentacle1000E;I shall leverage business contacts to get close to [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWTentacle1000Nope;On second thought, now is not the time to pursue [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWTentacle1001;[dw_mind_fuck_target.GetBestName] is in no position to resist me as I get close and stroke their skull with my tentacles. I begin my mental assault and I hear them whimper feebly as their body locks in place and the facial muscles relax. \n  I begin sliding tentacles into their ear canals and up their nose into their nasal cavity, with the end target for all of my hungry slithering feelers being [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName]'s soft brainy tissue. I impress upon them through my mental connection, how these are the last moments where they'll experience distaste and fear for what is coming. For once I'm done, that part within them that is crying out in resistance, will be no more. \n  The only question that is left as my tentacles reach the inner cranium and begin to slide along the folds of their brain, is just how I shall shape [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName]. \n  If there's some potential use to be gathered from them, I could simply render them slow and stupid, which would also improve their view of me for a period of time. \n  Or I could ruin their mind and leave them as an imbecile. A mockery of what they once were with a similar temporary improve outlook towards me. \n  Or I could break them down and open their most base urges. Leaving them as a stupid lunatic who is prone to bouts of both lust and rage, who shall see me forever more as their master. \n  Making my decision, I begin carving the appropriate paths along their brain, and chuckle to myself as their inner most fear and resistance towards me, dissolves along with their mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWTentacle1001A;I leave [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName] slow and stupid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWTentacle1001B;I leave [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName] a drooling imbecile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWTentacle1001C;I leave [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName] broken and insane.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWTentacle1001D;Already mentally stunted, I'll finish breaking [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWTentacle1002;I've spent the past few days observing [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName] from the shadows. Learning their habits as well as those of the people around them. \n  As night falls, I make my way unseen past man and animal, slipping into the building interior. I stick to the shadows and slip silently past doorways until I'm at [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName]'s bed chamber. I silently open the door and slip inside. \n  I make my way to [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName]'s bedside and stand over their helpless, sleeping form.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWTentacle1002.2;I've spent the past few days observing [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName] from the shadows. Learning their habits as well as those of the people around them. \n  As night falls, I make my way unseen past those outside, pausing just briefly as a dog barks aggressively in the night. Once silence falls again, I slip into the building interior. I stick to the shadows and slip silently past doorways until I'm at [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName]'s bed chamber. I open the door and slip inside. \n  I cross the room, my footsteps largely unregistered. I make my way to [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName]'s bedside and as I lean over, their eyes shoot open and a blade they had hidden under a pillow comes at me. The attempt to resist ultimately fails, as I've the leverage and surprise on my side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWTentacle1002.3;I've spent the past few days observing [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName] from the shadows. Learning their habits as well as those of the people around them. \n  As night falls, I make my way past those outside, noticing that there is an abundance of guards on patrol. I pause just briefly as a dog barks aggressively in the night, with it's noise setting off another nearby. I wait just briefly, ensuring that no one has noticed me before I move forward. Upon reaching my destination, I slip into the building interior. \n  I stick to the shadows and move past doorways until I'm at [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName]'s bed chamber. I open the door, hissing as hinges whine in protest and then I slip inside. \n  I cross the room quickly, noticing my quarry stirring as I approach. I leap upon [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName] and seek to restrain them. Angry eyes meet my own, as I notice a blade arc out from under a pillow. It strikes it's mark, yet it's too late. I'm in position and and the strike shall not dissuade me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWTentacle1002A;I have you now [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWTentacle1002B;Nice try, but I have you now [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWTentacle1002C;You shall be the one worse for wear [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWTentacle1003;I've taken the time observing [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName] to determine the best time to confront and break them. After learning their routine, I prepare to confront them when they're alone. \n  As [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName] steps outside for some evening air, I emerge from the shadows nearby. [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName]'s eyes go wide with shock as I dart forward and slam my fist into their throat, rending it to where they cannot cry out for help. \n  As [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName] gasps for air, I shove them to the ground and then pin them beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWTentacle1003.2;I've taken the time observing [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName] to determine the best time to confront and break them. After learning their routine, I prepare to confront them when they're alone. \n  As [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName] steps outside for some evening air, I emerge from the shadows nearby. [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName]'s eyes go wide with shock as I dart forward and strike at their throat. The blow doesn't connect cleanly, yet it's sufficient enough to keep them from crying for help. \n  As I move in towards [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName], they pull a dagger from their side and seek to fend me off. Unfortunately for them, momentum is on my side and soon their resistance is futile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWTentacle1003.3;I've taken the time observing [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName] to determine the best time to confront and break them. After learning their routine, I prepare to confront them when they're alone. \n  As [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName] steps outside for some evening air, I emerge from the shadows nearby. [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName]'s eyes focus on me as though they're not surprised. I dart forward and strike at their throat as they pull a blade. The blow doesn't connect cleanly, yet it's sufficient enough to leave them gasping as they charge me. \n  [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName] fights valiantly, managing to land their blade in me. Alas, their body weakens from the lack of air and they stumble. I waste no time, wrestling them to the ground and finally pinning them beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWTentacle1003A;I have you now [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWTentacle1003B;Nice try, but I have you now [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DWTentacle1004;I've spent the past few days working through various connections to get time alone with [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName] on the premise of trade negotiations. I've learned much about my quarry and after much preparation, a meeting is arranged. \n  As night falls, I make my way to the meeting place. I've worked to have [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName] believe that secrecy and urgency are paramount, and that we should be meeting alone. \n  As I enter our meeting place, [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName] is there all alone. I can't help but smirk as to how well they fell for it. \n  I maintain the lies, spinning a tale of how we can both make out from this rare arrangement as I pace about the room explaining the details. Finally, I set an offer in front of them, and smile to myself as they focus on the document. \n  I move behind [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName], and while they are focused on the document and not me, I silently strike...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

They seemed to be ready, as a hidden blade comes at me. The attempt to resist ultimately fails, as they foolishly allowed me the more advantageous position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

I struggle with [dw_mind_fuck_target.GetFirstName], my only advantage being that I was already standing above them. I press forward for the advantage. It doesn't come without a price, as their blade strikes true, yet they are now mine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
