DWBody100;During court today, a woman waited diligently for my time. When her time arrived, she shared that she was an aspiring painter.\n  Pressing on, she quickly acknowledged the plight that women artists have in finding work in the profession, let alone obtaining patronage.\n  In an attempt to overcome this challenge, she would like to paint my portrait, with no obligation for payment. Should I find it acceptable, she only asks that I hang the picture for all to see. If I allow it, the work should be done within a month's time.\n  After giving the request some thought I give my response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWBody100a;Please do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWBody100b;No thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWBody105;A month has passed and the woman who offered to paint my portrait shows me her work.\n  It's an interesting piece. One that shows me in what I can best describe as a more casual state. Devoid of the normal trappings of heraldry and station, that seem to dominate portrait paintings these days, she provided a more natural work. I notice that my package is quite pronounced, and I comment on it.\n  The painter blushes a bit, yet insists that she didn't exaggerate, and that it's just so pronounced due to the angle and pose I selected.\n  Well, I often viewed myself as being well endowed. It's not like I've ever really tried to hide it.\n  Now, based on her request, if I was happy with it, I'd hang it for all to see. Otherwise, it'll be off to my private collection. After considering it, I make my decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWBody105a;Hang it for all to see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWBody105b;Add it to my private collection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWBody105c;Hang for all to see, with a bonus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWBody105d;Private Collection, with a bonus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
