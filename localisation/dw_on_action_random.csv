dw_randomevent100;I decided to visit the market today and while there, a rhythmic beat caught my attention. In following the sound, I found a group of people cheering a woman that was going through a very impressive series of moves.\n  As I watched, it at first seemed like a very energetic dance. Yet as I continued to watch, I began to envision a group of foes around the woman, and how her kicks, flips, spins, and hand-stands could instead be a series of combat moves. After some time passed, the performance was done.\n  I sought out the woman as the crowd began to disperse, and I inquired about her skill.\n  She spoke about how as a child, she was gangly and clumsy. How after watching dancers, she sought to improve herself. She spoke some of her trials in becoming more limber, what worked and what did not for her. Alas, as she became more agile, she also grew frustrated as by then she was viewed by dance teachers as being too old, or some part of her being too muscular.\n She shares that her current dance style really came together when a former lover spent some time teaching her how to defend herself. While waiting on him one day, she began having an imaginary fight, worked in a few acrobatic moves, and suddenly she had spectators. Those spectators being the musicians she now travels with. When they added a beat, it seemed to help steady her pacing and over time, she's worked in more acrobatic type moves.\n  I thank her for her time and walk away pondering how it could be useful not just for dance, but for combat. My mind revisits the training routine she covered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_randomevent100a;I shall begin training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_randomevent100b;This isn't for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_randomevent101;I've managed to maintain my training over these past months. It wasn't always easy, and I finished a day with a small sprain or bruise on more than one occasion. It was also more than a little awkward at first when I began to involve combat moves into my agility training. The cook's assistant still scurries away when seeing me. Alas, I didn't intend to let the blade slip while doing that spinning handstand. Besides, it just struck the wall next to her, so she'll surely get over it with time.\n  I did find that smaller weapons, if not simply being unarmed entirely, seem to work best. Unless I don't get carried away with handstands or flips, then a normal blade, or event an axe works well with a quick spin. Now, a spear, that was fun, using it as a means for leverage on other moves was quite fun. So much, that I was distracted and still need to work on that a bit in order to use it properly.\n  In the end, I feel better and I'm more formidable, which is what I was seeking all along.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_randomevent101a;My agility has improved;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_randomevent110;I'm out for an evening walk, when I'm pretty certain I hear someone say 'please, no'. As I get closer towards the sound, I hear moaning, along with words of encouragement. I consider turning away, but decide to check anyway.\n  When I turn the corner, I'm surprised to find [tentacle_target.GetFirstName] stroking what looks like a bluish-purple phallic tentacle that has risen from the body of what appears to once having been a woman. [tentacle_target.GetFirstName] seems torn between lust and distress as he continues stroking and leans towards the being's neck.\n  I'm not certain what it is, but something about the other being reminds me of [tentacle_being.GetFirstName]. I understand that a person afflicted by a symbiote parasite, often has another form that it can assume. Could this be hers? Is she getting ready to implant the symbiote parasite into [tentacle_target.GetFirstName]?\n  That seems the most likely outcome if I choose to remain here and do nothing.\n  Am I willing to let [tentacle_target.GetFirstName] be turned, or do I stop it? I understand that once in a state like this, a symbiote will often fight to the death, so if I'm stopping this, I need to have the resolve to kill her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_randomevent110a;I must stop her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_randomevent110b;I leave them be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_randomevent110c;I must warn others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_randomevent120;I'm taking a short cut home when some movement catches my eye. I get a little closer and am shocked by what I find.\n  I see [tentacle_target.GetBestName] on their knees. Behind them is what looks like [tentacle_being.GetBestName], although they've changed drastically. No longer appearing fully human, their skin coloration has changed, as well as some kind of growth, and tentacles!\n  [tentacle_being.GetFirstName] is clearly part symbiote or tentacle-kin. [tentacle_target.GetFirstName] is drooling, their eyes rolled up in their head. It's almost a look of ecstasy. I then notice some of the tentacles look like they're in [tentacle_target.GetFirstName]'s ears. If this keeps on, [tentacle_target.GetFirstName] risks not only being infected, but they may suffer brain damage as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_randomevent120a;I must kill it now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_randomevent120b;Kids these days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_randomevent120c;I must warn others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_randomevent130;The battlefield is a brutal place. Filled with sweat and blood as both forces clash. I turn to shout out an order to nearby troops, and I notice a dark fog creeping in among the ranks of the fallen.\n  I watch as a form takes shape and steps out of the roiling fog. It is an impressive woman, clad in an otherworldly emerald colored armor. She scans the field and seeing me, approaches my direction.\n  Some of the troops spot her, yet I wave them off, as nothing in her approach is hostile towards me.\n  "You are [ROOT.GetBestName]. I am the Queen of Death, or Hela to those of this mortal realm who beg for boons from me. I'll be direct. I've need for the souls of the slain. Impede me not in my efforts, and I shall be willing to aid thee and thine realm."\n  As she waits for my response, I watch as she gives a corpse a come hither signal with her hand. The corpse seems to draw in some of the dark fog and the body lurches upright. With jagged movement, it moves to stand along side Hela as though its a bodyguard.\n  Alas, the battlefield is not the place for long reflection. I must provide an answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_randomevent130a;Yes, join me Hela.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_randomevent130b;Now is not the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_randomevent130c;Never bother me again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_randomevent140;I hear the sound of dogs barking aggressively while out walking the grounds. I decide to investigate and head towards the commotion.\n  When I arrive, I see wary people giving a group of impressive dogs a wide berth. They're all very muscular and strain their ropes as they bark at anyone who strays a little to close.\n  I see a Captain of the Guard speaking to a merchant, who has one of the impressive animals sitting obediently at his side. The Captain notices me and motions in my direction. The merchant turns and with a command, calls for the dogs to cease their behavior. They all retreat and sit, the sudden silence a stark contrast to a moment before.\n  I make my way over and the Captain introduces me to the merchant. A trainer of war dogs he says, reliable beasts that have been trained to respond to a number of commands. It's admittedly impressive, and as I look over them, I find myself inquiring as to their cost. His response is ten gold coins for one.\n  They are nice looking beasts, clearly obedient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_randomevent140a;I'll take one... has a gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_randomevent140b;I'll give you 6 coins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_randomevent140c;You have a deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dw_randomevent140d;I'll pass for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
